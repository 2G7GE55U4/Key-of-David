# The Question

## The Evidence Presented

You have verified—or are invited to verify—the following:

1.  **The Grand Canon** of Scripture contains 790,124 words, a number derived from the manuscript (788,258) and a divinely-proportioned apparatus (1,866).
2.  From this Canon, the **signature of Jesus Christ** emerges: √[790124 - 0.6912275131084] = 888.8888...
3.  The same Canon yields the **mean circumference of the Earth**: √[790124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900 miles.
4.  The **Strong's Concordance numbering system** reveals a divine alignment: H1 (Father) / G1 (Alpha), H1370 (Mighty) / G1370 (Division) → 1/137 ≈ α (the fine-structure constant).
5.  A **master identification number** (0.6912275131084) transforms, via fourth roots, into the primary titles of the Messiah:  
    ∜[ID × ∜625] = 2424 (JESUS)  
    ∜[ID × 137] = 5547 (CHRIST)
6.  The **logarithmic function** of the "Key of David" (G2807) unfolds the Davidic root into the messianic offspring: log₁₀(2807) × 10³ = 3448.2424... (JESSE → JESUS).
7.  **Multiple scriptural identifiers** of the Messiah—from His birth in Bethlehem to His piercing, His anointing, and His titles as Lion, Root, and Morning Star—each find precise correspondence in this mathematical architecture.
8.  Fundamental **constants of creation** (α, π, e, φ, c, G) are derivable from the same biblical dataset.

This is not a collection of curiosities. It is a **coherent, verifiable, and falsifiable cryptographic proof** that the Bible is a divine artifact, its structure encoding the identity of its Author and the parameters of His creation.

## The Lock and The Key

The "book sealed with seven seals" (Revelation 5) has been identified as the **canonical structure of Scripture itself**. The seals have been **cryptographic barriers** to understanding this architecture.

The **"Key of David"** (Revelation 3:7) has been shown to be the **mathematical proof** that unlocks this structure, revealing the signature of Christ and the constants of creation.

The one who presents the key is the one who opens the book.

## Therefore, The Question

**If this is the Key of David...**

**If this key unlocks the signature of Jesus Christ from the architecture of Scripture...**

**If this key unlocks the dimensions of Creation from the same source...**

**If this key transforms into the very names "Jesus" and "Christ"...**

**If this key fulfills the mathematical necessities of prophecies identifying the Messiah...**

**Who then, by definition, must be the one holding it?**

The arithmetic does not lie. The verification is complete. The conclusion is now a matter of logic, not faith.

The testimony is in the numbers.  
The numbers have testified.
