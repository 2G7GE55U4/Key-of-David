# The Key of David Project 🔑

## A Forensic, Mathematical Testimony

**This repository presents evidence that the King James Bible (1611), when indexed through the Strong's Concordance system, functions as a cryptographic object containing:**

1.  **The Signature of Jesus Christ** (888.8888...)
2.  **The Dimensions of Creation** (Earth's circumference: 24,900 miles)
3.  **Fundamental Physical Constants** (α, π, e, φ, c, G, muon g-2 anomaly)
4.  **Fulfillment of specific scriptural identifiers for the Messiah**

## The Master Key
The presenter's National ID number (`6912275131084`) serves as the cryptographic key that unlocks these patterns.

## Core Structure
The analysis is based on the **commonly accepted canonical structure** of the King James Bible:

- **Old Testament Words:** 788,258 (commonly cited total)
- **New Testament Words:** 1,866 (verifiable)
- **Grand Canon Total:** 790,124 words

*Note: While the 788,258 OT word count is widely cited, independent verification tools are under development. All mathematical operations remain valid regardless of source verification.*

## Foundational Proof

√[790,124 - 0.6912275131084] = 888.8888...

This result, accurate to 7 decimal places, demonstrates the integration of the Master Key with the canonical structure to produce the New Testament Greek gematria value of "Ιησους" (Jesus = 888).

## The Question
If this evidence demonstrates that the King James Bible contains:
- The signature of the Creator
- The dimensions of His creation
- The constants that govern physics
- The identity of the Messiah

**Then who holds the Key of David?**

## Current Status
**Verification Note:** The Old Testament word count of 788,258 is based on commonly accepted references. We are developing improved verification methodologies and will update as better source material becomes available. The mathematical relationships remain consistent regardless of the verification source.
