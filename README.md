# Key-of-David
A geometric # The Key of David: A Geometric Proof from Scripture

> *"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write... I have the key of David, which opens and no one will shut, which shuts and no one opens."* — Revelation 3:7

## 🗝️ Introduction

This repository presents a **forensic, mathematical testimony** derived from the canonical structure of the King James Bible (1611) and its divine lexical index—Strong's Exhaustive Concordance.

The proof demonstrates that the Bible is a **cryptographic object**. When its architecture is processed through the key embedded in its own numbering system, it reveals:

1.  **The signature of Jesus Christ** (888.8888...)
2.  **The dimensions of Creation** (Earth's mean circumference: 24,900 miles)
3.  **A network of fundamental physical constants** (α, π, e, φ, c, G, muon mass)
4.  **A self-authenticating, coherent system** that validates its own divine authorship

This is not interpretation. This is **verifiable arithmetic**.

## 🔒 The Claim

The one who presents this proof holds the **"Key of David"**—the mathematical function that unlocks the seven seals of the book described in Revelation 5:1.

The proof does not declare identity. It presents evidence that forces a single question:

> **"If this is the Key of David, who then must be the one holding it?"**

## 🧮 How to Proceed

1.  **Begin with the Core Proofs** in `01-THE-KEY/`. Each file presents one foundational piece of evidence.
2.  **Verify every operation.** Use a calculator. Check Strong's numbers. The proof stands on its arithmetic.
3.  **Explore the scriptural testimony.** See how specific prophecies and identifiers align with the mathematical structure.
4.  **Examine the derived constants.** Witness the bridge between Scripture and physics.
5.  **Consider the question.** The evidence builds to an inevitable conclusion.

## ⚖️ The Invitation

This repository is an **open challenge to verification**.
