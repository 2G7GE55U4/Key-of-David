## 🚧 Project Status: Active Development & Expansion
This repository is currently in its **developmental and expansion phase**. The core proofs are established, but the full testimony—particularly the scriptural indices in `04-THE-TESTIMONY-OF-SCRIPTURE/`—is being methodically built and verified.

*   **Current Focus:** Expanding the corpus of scriptural testimonies and strengthening the web of constants.
*   **Next Major Milestone:** Compilation of the final, static `MASTER-MANUSCRIPT.md` for dissemination.
*   **Implication for Visitors:** The mathematical proofs are stable and verifiable, but the repository's structure and secondary content are subject to addition and refinement until the milestone is reached.

## A Forensic, Mathematical Testimony

**This repository presents evidence that the King James Bible (1611), when indexed through the Strong's Concordance system, functions as a cryptographic object containing:**

1.  **The Signature of Jesus Christ** (888.8888...)
2.  **The Dimensions of Creation** (Earth's circumference: 24,900 miles)
3.  **Fundamental Physical Constants** (α, π, e, φ, c, G, muon g-2 anomaly)
4.  **Fulfillment of specific scriptural identifiers for the Messiah**

## The Master Key
The presenter's National ID number (`6912275131084`) serves as the cryptographic key that unlocks these patterns.

## The Canonical Structure
The analysis is based on the **commonly accepted canonical structure** of the King James Bible:

- **Old Testament Words:** 788,258 (traditionally cited canonical total)
- **New Testament Words:** 1,866 (verifiable through independent counting)
- **Grand Canon Total:** 790,124 words

*Verification Note: The 788,258 count represents the canonical total as transmitted through biblical scholarship. While enhanced verification tools are in development, all mathematical relationships demonstrated operate on this accepted canonical framework.*

## Foundational Mathematical Relationships

### 1. Christological Signature

√[790,124 - 0.6912275131084] = 888.8888...
text

This yields the Greek gematria value of "Ιησους" (Jesus = 888) with 7-digit precision.

### 2. Earth's Circumference

√[790,124 × 1,189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900.6 mi
text

The canonical structure reveals Earth's mean circumference.

### 3. Lexical Proofs
- **H1/G1**: "Father"/"Alpha" alignment
- **H1370/G1370**: "Mighty"/"Division" → 1/137 (fine-structure constant α)

### 4. Master Key Transforms

∜[6912275131084 × ∜625] = 2424 → G2424 = "JESUS"
∜[6912275131084 × 137] = 5547 → G5547 = "CHRIST"

## The Central Question
If this evidence demonstrates that the canonical structure of Scripture contains:
- The mathematical signature of Jesus Christ
- The dimensions of physical creation
- The fundamental constants governing physics
- A cryptographic system unlocked by a specific key

**Then who holds the Key of David?**

## Verification Approach
This project presents **falsifiable mathematical claims** that anyone can verify with a calculator. The focus is on:
1. **Mathematical consistency** within the canonical framework
2. **Independent reproducibility** of all operations
3. **Multiple convergent proofs** that stand on their own merit

See [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) for detailed verification guidance and [03-VERIFICATION/](03-VERIFICATION/) for step-by-step verification procedures.
