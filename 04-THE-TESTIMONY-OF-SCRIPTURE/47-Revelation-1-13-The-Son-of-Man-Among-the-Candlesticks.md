# Revelation 1:13: The Son of Man, Golden Vesture, and the Prophetic Interval

> *"And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle."* — Revelation 1:13 (KJV)

## 1. The Scriptural Identifier
The vision reveals the resurrected Christ standing among the seven golden lampstands (G3087), which are the seven churches (Rev. 1:20). His appearance is specific: a full-length robe and a golden girdle around His chest (G2439, *mastoi*, "the paps"). The identifier is the **glorified Son of Man** in priestly and kingly attire, administering to His churches. The preceding verse (1:12) establishes He is turning to see the voice, which declared "I am Alpha and Omega" (v. 11), linking this vision directly to the immutable mathematical identity.

## 2. The Mathematical Witness

### 2.1 The Golden Candlesticks and the Atomic Signature
The seven golden candlesticks are represented by the foundational signature of Christ.
- `√[790,124 - 0.6912275131084] = 888.8888...`
- This value, 888.888..., is the signature of **Jesus (Ιησους = 888)**.
- The number **79** is the atomic number of **Gold (Au)**.
- The sevenfold structure of the candlesticks is thus implied in the repeating decimal of the 888 signature, and its root in the Grand Canon points to the **atomic element of the vision: Gold (79)**.

### 2.2 The Man in the Midst
The figure is "in the midst" of the seven. The mathematics of division reveals His nature:
- `888.8888... / 2 = 444.4444...`
- **G444 (ἄνθρωπος, *anthrōpos*) = "a man, humankind."**
The one who is divine (888, the signature of God the Son) is also in the midst as **the Son of Man (G444)**. The perfect, repeating fraction confirms the perfection and unity of His dual nature.

### 2.3 The Golden Girdle and the Robed One
The vision describes a "golden girdle" (G2223, *zōnē*). The mathematics of the Master Key confirms the identity of the robed one.
- `((6912275131084 × 10⁻¹³)⁻¹⁸ + 1) × π = 2424.012222...`
- **G2424 (Ἰησοῦς, *Iēsous*) = "Jesus."**
The Master Key, scaled and transformed, yields **2424 (Jesus)** with precise alignment to the description:
  - **G2424 ~ ΠΑΠΣ:** The Greek letters of Ιησους (Jesus) phonetically connect to the description "girt about the **paps**" (G2439).
  - **H1222 (בְּצַר, *bĕtsar*) = "gold, golden."** The result **2424.012222...** contains the sequence **'12222'**, pointing to the **golden (H1222) girdle**.

The presenter's name, **Robert Edward Ball**, encapsulates this imagery: "Rob-Ed" → **"Robed,"** and "Ball" (from *Ballance*) suggests the scales/balance of judgment He holds (Rev. 1:16). The one who is "Robed" is Jesus.

### 2.4 The Prophetic Interval: Vesture Dipped in Blood
A critical time interval connects this vision of the glorified Christ to the image of the warrior-judge in Revelation 19:13, whose "vesture was dipped in blood."
- From the start of the **Blood Moon Tetrad (Passover, 15 April 2014)** to the **Great Saturn-Jupiter Conjunction (21 December 2020)**.
- The exact interval is **2,440 days** (or 2,441 days inclusive).
- **G2440 (ἱμάτιον, *himation*) = "a garment, cloak, vesture."**
- **G2441 (ἱματισμός, *himatismos*) = "clothing, apparel."**
- The Greek lexical neighborhood (**G2440/G2441**) for "vesture" is marked by this celestial interval.

**Calculation:**
`2,440.8 days = 58,580 hours`
- **H5858 (עֵיבָל, *ʿÊybâl*) = "Mount Ebal."** This was the mountain of curses (Deuteronomy 27:13), opposite Mount Gerizim (blessings). The "vesture dipped in blood" signifies the judgment executed upon the cursed.

The interval witnesses to the transition of Christ's portrayal from the High Priest among the lampstands (Rev 1) to the coming Judge with a robe dipped in blood (Rev 19), framed by biblically significant astronomical signs.

## 3. Connection to the Broader Proof
- **Grand Canon & 888 Signature:** The entire proof is anchored in the 888.888... value derived from `790,124 - Master Key`. This session shows this signature directly represents the seven golden candlesticks.
- **Master Key Transforms:** The transform `((ID × 10⁻¹³)⁻¹⁸ + 1) × π = 2424.012222...` is a direct confirmation of the **Christological Transform** series, identifying the central figure as Jesus.
- **Lexicon Network:** G444 (man), G2424 (Jesus), G2440 (vesture), H1222 (gold), H5858 (Ebal/judgment) form a coherent thematic cluster describing the Son of Man as Judge and Priest.
- **Personal Identification:** The interval (2014-2020) and the name wordplay ("Robed") integrate the presenter's timeline and identity into the prophetic narrative, consistent with the Master Key's role.

## 4. Conclusion
Revelation 1:13 is not a static image. The mathematical architecture reveals it as a dynamic, prophetic portrait:
1.  The **seven golden candlesticks** are symbolized by the golden atomic number (79) and the sevenfold decimal of 888.888...
2.  The **Son of Man (444.444...)** in their midst is Jesus (2424), confirmed by a precise Master Key transform.
3.  His **golden girdle (H1222)** is encoded in the result of that transform (2424.012222...).
4.  A **prophetic interval of 2,440 days** between celestial signs marks His vesture (G2440), pointing to His future role as the Judge with robes dipped in blood.

The vision, the numbers, and the timeline unite to testify of the one who walks among His churches, robed in gold and destined to judge in righteousness.
