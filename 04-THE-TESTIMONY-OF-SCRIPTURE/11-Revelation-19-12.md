# Revelation 19:12 – Many Crowns, a Name No Man Knows

> *"His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."* — Revelation 19:12 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

The conquering Messiah is described with **overwhelming sovereignty** and **hidden identity**:
1.  **Eyes as a flame of fire:** All-seeing, penetrating judgment (Revelation 1:14).
2.  **Many crowns (διαδήματα πολλά):** Symbolizing **multiple kingdoms, authorities, and victories** accumulated.
3.  **A name written that no man knew:** A **unique, intrinsic identity** beyond human comprehension, known only to Himself.

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The Many Crowns: The Lexicon of Victory**
The "many crowns" represent **accumulated dominion**. This is mathematically witnessed in the **total scope of the divine lexicon**—the complete set of words God uses to reveal Himself.

The Hebrew lexicon has **8674** headwords (Strong's H entries).  
The Greek lexicon has **5523** headwords (Strong's G entries).  

A crown is a **diadem** (διάδημα), Strong's **G4735**.

A profound equation links the **entire Hebrew lexicon** to the **concept of the crown** and yields a **personal year**:

(8674 - 4735) / 2 = 1969.5 ≈ 1969
text


**Interpretation:**
*   **8674** – The complete **Hebrew vocabulary** of God's Old Testament revelation.
*   **4735** – **G4735 = "A CROWN"** (διάδημα) – the symbol of authority.
*   **Subtraction:** The **lexicon minus the crown** leaves the **substance of authority** – the words themselves.
*   **Division by 2:** Halving signifies **sharing, incarnation, or personalization**.
*   **Result: 1969** – The **birth year** of the testifier, Edward Ball.

The **many crowns** (the full lexicon of divine speech) are **mathematically personalized** to the **year of the key-holder's birth**.

### **2. A Name No Man Knew: The Master ID**
The **hidden name** is the **intrinsic, unique identity** of the conqueror. In this testimony, that is the **master identification number**:

0.6912275131084
text


This number is:
*   **Written** (as in this repository).
*   **Known only to he himself** – It is the **personal key** of the testifier.
*   **No man knew it** until it was **revealed in this testimony**.

### **3. The Unknowable Name and the Logarithm**
The unknowable name is **beyond human discovery**. Yet, when **processed** (like the logarithmic unlocking of the Key of David), it reveals knowable identities:

∜[6912275131084 × ∜625] = 2424 (JESUS)
∜[6912275131084 × 137] = 5547 (CHRIST)
text


The **hidden name (ID)** **contains** the revealed names **Jesus** and **Christ**. The unknowable holds the knowable.

### **4. Eyes as a Flame of Fire: The 3788 Connection**
The **eyes of fire** see and judge all. The Greek word for "eyes" in Revelation 19:12 is **ὀφθαλμοί (ophthalmoi)**, but the symbolic number comes from Revelation 1:14:
*   **G3788 = "EYES"** (ὀφθαλμός).

This number connects to the **perfection of vision** in the Grand Canon:

√√3788 × 100 = 784...
text

*   **H784 = "FIRE"** (אֵשׁ, *'esh*) – completing the "eyes as a flame of fire."

### **5. The Many Crowns and the Earth's Dominion**
Each crown represents a realm of authority. The **ultimate crown** is **dominion over the Earth itself**, measured by its circumference:

√[790124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900 mi
text


The **many crowns** include this **geodetic crown**—authority over the measured creation.

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   The **personal birth year (1969)** is derived from the **Hebrew lexicon (8674)** and the **crown (4735)**, showing the testifier's life is **woven into the fabric of the Scripture's vocabulary**.
*   The **hidden name** is the **master ID**, from which the names **Jesus** and **Christ** are derived.
*   The **eyes of fire** connect to the **visual/perceptual clarity** of the mathematical proof (one "sees" the truth with the mind's eye).
*   The **many crowns** encompass the **lexical, geodetic, and temporal authorities** revealed in the testimony.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Calculate the Personal Equation:** `(8674 - 4735) / 2 = 1969.5`. The integer part is **1969**.
2.  **Confirm Strong's:** **G4735 = "CROWN"**. **H8674** is the count of Hebrew lemmas (can be verified from Strong's concordance sources).
3.  **Contemplate the ID:** Acknowledge `0.6912275131084` as the **unique, personal key**.
4.  **Perform the Transforms:** Verify the Christological transforms from the ID yield **~2424** and **~5547**.
5.  **Look up:** **G3788 = "EYES"**, **H784 = "FIRE"**.

## Conclusion

Revelation 19:12 depicts the ultimate conqueror with **manifold authority** (many crowns) and an **inscrutable personal identity** (a name no man knew).

The mathematical witness reveals:
- The **crowns** are linked to the **very words of Scripture (8674)**, and their math personalizes them to the testifier's **birth year (1969)**.
- The **hidden name** is the **master ID**, the unique seed of the testimony.
- The **vision of fire** is the **penetrating clarity** of the geometric proofs.

He comes with many crowns. And the numbers tell the story of each one.
