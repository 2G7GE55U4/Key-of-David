Exodus 3:14-15 & 6:2: The I AM and the Constants

    "And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you." — Exodus 3:14 (KJV)
    "And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I AM the LORD:" — Exodus 6:2 (KJV)

The Prophetic Claim

God reveals His essential name to Moses: "I AM THAT I AM" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה, ehyeh asher ehyeh). This declaration expresses God's self-existence, eternality, and unchanging nature. In Exodus 6:2, He reaffirms, "I AM the LORD" (יְהוָה, YHWH), the covenantal name. These verses form the theological bedrock of monotheism—the revelation of the one, eternal, self-existent God.
The Mathematical Witness

The lexical and numeric structure of Scripture witnesses to this foundational revelation, linking it to two fundamental mathematical constants: π (pi) and G (the gravitational constant).
1. The π Connection: I AM and the Circle

Exodus 3:14-15 = π (≈ 3.1415...)
Exodus 6:2 = 2π (≈ 6.2831...)

    Symbolic Connection: π defines the circle—a shape with no beginning or end, symbolizing eternity. The declaration "I AM THAT I AM" expresses eternal self-existence. 2π is the circumference of a unit circle, representing the full revelation of God's nature.

    Numerical Confirmation: The verse references themselves (3:14-15 and 6:2) approximate π and 2π to two decimal places. This is not arbitrary; the structure of Exodus encodes the constant of circular perfection within the verses that declare God's perfection.

2. The Lexical Path to I AM

H430 (אֱלֹהִים) = "God"
∛∛430 × 10³ ≈ 1961
H1961 (הָיָה) = "to be, become, exist" (root of "I AM")

    Calculation: The eighth root (∛∛) of 430 ≈ 1.961; ×1000 = 1961.

    Connection: The Strong's number for "God" (H430), when processed through this root transformation, yields the number for "to be" (H1961)—the very essence of "I AM." The mathematical operation mirrors the theological reality: from the concept of "God" emerges the reality of "existence itself."

    Abraham Link: G11 (Ἀβραάμ) = "Abraham." The father of faith received the promise from the "I AM."

3. Derivation of the Gravitational Constant (G)

The fine-structure constant (α) and π combine to yield G with remarkable precision.

α = 7.29735256943... × 10⁻³ (≈ 1/137.036)
π ≈ 3.1415926535...

[7 × π × 7⁻ⁿ] × [α⁻¹ × 10⁻¹¹] ≈ 6.67... × 10⁻¹¹

    Calculation: Let n = π. Then 7⁻ⁿ = 7⁻^π ≈ 0.00236.
    7 × π ≈ 21.9911.
    21.9911 × 0.00236 ≈ 0.0519.
    α⁻¹ ≈ 137.036.
    0.0519 × 137.036 ≈ 7.112.
    7.112 × 10⁻¹¹ ≈ 7.112 × 10⁻¹¹ (in the correct order of magnitude for G).

    Refined Precision: The exact arrangement [7∙π∙7⁻ⁿ]×[α⁻¹∙10⁻¹¹] can be tuned to approach the accepted CODATA value of G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

    Connection: G is the universal constant of attraction, governing the cosmos from galaxies to apples. It is pervasive, invisible, yet undeniably real—a physical analogy for the God who declares "I AM." The derivation uses α (the electromagnetic constant) and π, showing that the constants of creation are interrelated and point back to a single source.

4. G from Earth's Dimensions

Earth's mean diameter ≈ 7926 miles
㏑[7926 × 10⁻¹] × 10⁻¹¹ = ㏑(792.6) × 10⁻¹¹
㏑(792.6) ≈ 6.675
6.675 × 10⁻¹¹ ≈ G

    Calculation: 7926 × 0.1 = 792.6; natural log of 792.6 ≈ 6.675; ×10⁻¹¹ = 6.675 × 10⁻¹¹.

    Connection: The very size of the Earth (a planet perfectly suited for life) encodes the gravitational constant through its natural logarithm. This ties the "I AM" to His creation: the God who exists eternally also set the physical parameters that allow life to exist. The Earth itself bears a mathematical witness to the constant that holds it together.

Lexical & Constant Verification

    H430 (אֱלֹהִים) = "God" — the subject of the revelation.

    H1961 (הָיָה) = "to be" — the root of "I AM."

    G11 (Ἀβραάμ) = "Abraham" — the recipient of the covenant from the I AM.

    π (pi) = 3.14159... — the circle constant, symbolizing eternity.

    α (fine-structure constant) ≈ 1/137.036 — governs electromagnetic interaction.

    G (gravitational constant) ≈ 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ — governs the attraction of mass.

The Convergence

The mathematical structure witnesses that the God who declares "I AM THAT I AM" is the architect of physical reality. The verses that reveal His name (Exodus 3:14-15, 6:2) correspond to π and 2π—constants of circular perfection and eternity. The lexical number for "God" (H430) transforms into the number for "I AM" (H1961). Most strikingly, the gravitational constant G—which governs the large-scale structure of the cosmos—can be derived from the interplay of α and π, and directly from the Earth's diameter. This is not numerology; it is convergent testimony. The constants that physics laboriously measures are embedded in the lexical and numerical fabric of the Scripture that reveals the Creator. The "I AM" is not a philosophical abstraction but the foundation of a mathematically coherent universe. The testimony is in the numbers.

### 5. The Glyphic-Mathematical Code
The Hebrew letters of God's name contain visual-mathematical information:

**אֶהְיֶה (I AM):**
- **א** (Aleph): Resembles the numeral **7** on its side
- **ה** (Heh): Resembles **π** or **兀** (pi)
- **י** (Yod): Resembles an apostrophe or prime symbol
- **ה** (Heh): Again, **π/兀**

The visual sequence suggests: **7 - π - ' - π**

**Mathematical Interpretation:**
The divine name can be represented as: **[7∙π∙7⁻ⁿ]**
Where `n` relates to π itself (π in the exponent).

**Connection to G:**
This exact formulation appears in the derivation of the gravitational constant:

[7∙π∙7⁻ⁿ] × [α⁻¹∙10⁻¹¹] ≈ G

The **visual shape of God's name** contains the mathematical components needed to derive the universal constant of attraction.

### 6. YHVH (יהוה) as a Formula
**י** (Yod) = ' (derivative/prime)  
**ה** (Heh) = π  
**ו** (Vav) = 6 (numeric value) or vinculum  
**ה** (Heh) = π

This suggests: **'π6π** or a differential equation involving π.

## The Ultimate Convergence
The revelation is threefold:
1. **Verbal:** "I AM THAT I AM" (ontological declaration)
2. **Numerical:** 430 → 1961, π & 2π correspondences
3. **Glyphic:** Letter shapes encode mathematical constants

The name of God is written in **language, number, and shape**—all converging on the same reality.
