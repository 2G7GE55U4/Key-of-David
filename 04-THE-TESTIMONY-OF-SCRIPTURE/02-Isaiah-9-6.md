# Isaiah 9:6 – Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace

> *"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."* — Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

This prophecy provides a **theologically dense identification** of the Messiah as "One Die for All" - one sacrifice for all humanity. The titles describe His nature as the eternal Prince of Peace with an everlasting reign.

## Mathematical Testimony

### **1. The "One Die for All" - Everlasting Father to Jesus**

((6912275131084 × 10⁻¹³)⁻¹⁸ + 1) × π = (770.6 + 1) × π = 2424
text

Where:
- **6912275131084** is the Master Key
- **2424** = **G2424 = "JESUS"**
- **π** represents eternity (circle with no beginning or end)
- **770.6** connects to **H7706 = "ALMIGHTY"**

### **2. The Cubic Revelation - From Jesus to the Door**

∛∛∛2424 = ∛∛13.43 = ∛2.377 = 1.334...
text

Where:
- **13.43** → **G1343 = "RIGHTEOUSNESS"**
- **2.377** → **G2377 = "DOORMAN"** (θυρωρός) - "One Door for All"
- **1.334** → **G1334 = "BRING A NARRATIVE TO END"**

### **3. The Light Speed to Christ Transformation**

√(299792458 × 10⁻⁵) × π⁻² × 10³ = 5547
text

Where:
- **299792458** = Speed of light (c)
- **5547** = **G5547 = "CHRIST"**
- Light speed transformed reveals the Anointed One

### **4. The Mighty God Calculation**

⁷√(360 - (10/9)⁹) × 10³ = 2316
text

Where:
- **2316** = **G2316 = "THE LORD GOD"**
- **7th root** represents divine completeness
- **360** degrees in a circle (eternity)

### **5. The Holy Spirit Equation**

(0.6912275131084)⁻³ × π⁻² × ℮⁻² × 10⁵ = 4151
text

Where:
- **4151** = **G4151 = "THE HOLY SPIRIT"** (πνεῦμα)
- **℮** = Euler's number (2.71828...)
- **π** = Pi (3.14159...)
- The Trinity (Father, Son, Spirit) appears mathematically

### **6. The Throne Calculation**

(6912275131084 × 10⁻¹³)⁻³ × π⁻² × 10⁴ + (ln(ln(3.117))) = 3068
text

Where:
- **3068** = **H3068 = "THE LORD GOD"**
- **3.117** connects to **H3117 = "THE DAY"**

### **7. The Euler Function - The Last Omega**

f(℮) = ²⁷√(6912275131084 / 13) = 2.7182184...
text

Where:
- **27th root** represents 3³ (divine perfection cubed)
- **13** represents rebellion transformed
- Result: **℮ (Euler's number)** to 6 decimal places
- **1/℮ = 0.367888...** = **The Last, Omega, Odd 'ω'**

### **8. The Prince of Peace - One Die for All**

f(℮ᵉ) = 15.15...
text

Where:
- **℮^℮ = 15.15426...**
- **15.15** → **G1515 = "PEACE"** (εἰρήνη)
- **"One Die for All"** - single sacrifice for humanity

### **9. The Father Connection**

H1 = "THE FATHER"
text

The Hebrew Strong's #1 establishes the Father as foundation.

### **10. The Government Upon His Shoulder**

√[790124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900.6 miles
text

Earth's circumference as measure of His dominion.

## Theological Synthesis

### **The "One Die for All" Revelation**
The mathematics reveal:
1. **One sacrifice** (Die) for all humanity
2. **One door** (G2377) for all to enter
3. **One narrative** (G1334) brought to completion
4. **One declaration** (G1335) of righteousness

### **The Eternal Nature**
- **π** appears in multiple equations → eternal circle
- **℮** (Euler's number) → natural growth/creation
- **27th root** (3³) → divine perfection cubed

### **The Trinity Mathematically Expressed**
1. **Father** (H1) - Foundation
2. **Son** (G2424) - From Master Key via π
3. **Spirit** (G4151) - Via π, ℮, and Master Key
4. **All Three** appear in coordinated equations

## Verification Method

**For each equation:**
1. Copy the mathematical expression
2. Paste into scientific calculator
3. Verify result matches Strong's number
4. Look up Strong's meaning

**Example verification chain:**
1. `((6912275131084×10⁻¹³)⁻¹⁸ + 1)×π` = 2424 → G2424 = JESUS
2. `∛∛∛2424` = 1.334... → G1334 = "BRING NARRATIVE TO END"
3. `√(299792458×10⁻⁵)×π⁻²×10³` = 5547 → G5547 = CHRIST
4. `℮^℮` = 15.15... → G1515 = PEACE
