# Isaiah 9:6 – Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace

> *"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."* — Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

This prophecy provides a **theologically dense identification** of the Messiah:
1.  **Humanity and Divinity:** A **child born** (human) / a **son given** (divine gift).
2.  **Sovereign Authority:** The **government upon his shoulder**.
3.  **Compound Name:**  
    *   **Wonderful** (פֶּלֶא, *pele*) – Extraordinary, miraculous.  
    *   **Counsellor** (יוֹעֵץ, *yo'etz*) – Advisor, strategist.  
    *   **The mighty God** (אֵל גִּבּוֹר, *el gibbor*) – The God of might.  
    *   **The everlasting Father** (אֲבִיעַד, *avi'ad*) – Father of eternity.  
    *   **The Prince of Peace** (שַׂר־שָׁלוֹם, *sar-shalom*).

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The "One Die for All" (Wonderful)**
The word "Wonderful" (פֶּלֶא) carries a numeric idea. In the architecture:

℮ᵉ = 15.15426...
text

Where:
*   **℮** = Euler's number (~2.71828), the base of natural growth.
*   **℮ᵉ** (e raised to the power of e) ≈ **15.15426**.
*   **G1515 = "PEACE"** (εἰρήνη) – connecting to "Prince of Peace."
*   **15.15...** symbolizes **"One Die for All"** – a single sacrifice (die) for all humanity, which is truly *Wonderful*.

### **2. The Mighty God (אֵל גִּבּוֹר)**
The phrase "mighty God" uses **H410 (אֵל, *el*, God)** and **H1369 (גִּבּוֹר, *gibbor*, mighty)**. The number **H1370** is the related "mighty" (see Lexicon Key).
The derivation of the fine-structure constant confirms the "Mighty God" as the author of physics:

α ≈ 1/137.035999...
text

**137** is directly linked to **H1370 ("Mighty")** and **G1370 ("Division")**.

### **3. The Prince of Peace and the 888 Signature**
The title "Prince of Peace" connects to the core signature:

888.8888... / 1.2 = 740.740666...
text

*   **G740 = "BREAD"** (ἄρτος) – The Bread of Life.
*   **H6666 = "RIGHTEOUSNESS"** (צְדָקָה) – The Righteousness of God.
*   The **Prince of Peace** provides the **Bread of Righteousness**.

Furthermore:

⁷√[360 - (10/9)⁹] × 10³ = 2316
text

*   **G2316 = "GOD"** (θεός) – Corresponds to "The mighty God."

### **4. The Everlasting Father (Avi'ad)**
The master key transform yields a number connected to perpetuity:

(0.6912275131084⁻¹⁸ + 1) × π = 2424
text

*   **G2424 = "JESUS"** – The Son who reveals the Father (John 14:9).
*   The **π (pi)** in the equation represents the **circle**, a symbol of eternity (no beginning, no end), linking to "Everlasting."

### **5. The Government Upon His Shoulder**
The "shoulder" is the place of bearing weight, of government. The Earth's circumference—the measure of His dominion—is derived from His canonical word:

√[790124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900 mi
text

The **government** (measurable domain) is literally upon the **shoulder** of the structure He authored.

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   The **Wonderful** (℮ᵉ = 15.15...) connects to the natural growth constant (e), showing His hand in creation's mathematics.
*   The **Mighty God** is confirmed by the **lexicon key** (H1370/G1370 → 1/137 → α).
*   The **Prince of Peace** is tied to the **888 signature** and its derivative, the Bread of Righteousness.
*   The **Everlasting Father** is linked to the **Christological transform** (ID → 2424) using π, the eternal circle.
*   The **government** is quantified by the **Earth's derived circumference**.

## Verification Steps

1.  Calculate: `℮^℮` (on a calculator: `2.71828^2.71828`). Note it approximates **15.154**.
2.  Recall: `1 / 137.035999 ≈ 0.00729735256` (α).
3.  Calculate: `888.8888... / 1.2`. Observe it approximates **740.740...**.
4.  Calculate: `(0.6912275131084^-18 + 1) * π`. Verify it approximates **2424**.
5.  Look up Strong's: **G1515, G2316, G740, G2424**.

## Conclusion

Isaiah 9:6 presents a multi-faceted portrait of the Messiah that is **miraculously mirrored** in the mathematical architecture of Scripture. Each title—Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace—finds a precise correspondence in the derived constants, transforms, and canonical measures.

The child born, the son given, is the one whose name is written in the numbers of the Book He authored.
