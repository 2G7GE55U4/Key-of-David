# Revelation 22:16 – Root and Offspring of David, Bright Morning Star

> *"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star."* — Revelation 22:16 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

In His final self-identification in Scripture, Jesus declares a **dual relationship to David** and a **celestial identity**:
1.  **The root of David:** His **divine origin** as the **source** of David's life and kingship (Isaiah 11:1,10).
2.  **The offspring of David:** His **human descent** as the **fulfillment** of David's lineage (Matthew 1:1).
3.  **The bright and morning star:** The **herald of the new day**, the planet Venus at dawn, symbolizing **hope, victory, and royal glory** (Numbers 24:17, 2 Peter 1:19).

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The Root and Offspring: The Logarithmic Key**
The **root** (source) and **offspring** (product) are **inverse relationships**. This is perfectly expressed by the **logarithmic function** of the Key of David:

log₁₀(2807) × 10³ = 3448.2424...
text


*   **2807 = G2807 = "THE KEY"**.
*   **log₁₀** is the **function that finds the root (exponent)** that produces the number.
*   **3448 = H3448 = "JESSE"** – the **root** of the Davidic line.
*   **.2424 = G2424 = "JESUS"** – the **offspring** of David.

The **key** mathematically **unlocks the root (Jesse) to reveal the offspring (Jesus)**. The one operation contains both relationships.

### **2. The Bright Morning Star: The Solar Measure**
The "morning star" (Venus) reflects the light of the **Sun**. The ultimate **bright morning star** is the **Sun itself**—the source. Jesus is the **source of light**.

The **circumference of the Sun** is approximately **2,715,000 miles** (modern value: ~2.7154 million miles).  
This number is **derived from Jesus (2424) and a precise time constant**:

2424 × [1121 - 1/113] ≈ 2,717,282
text


**Breakdown:**
*   **2424 = G2424 = "JESUS"**.
*   **1121** – A number connected to **time**. 1,121 days is approximately **3.069 years**.
*   **1/113 ≈ 0.008849557** – The inverse of **113**, a number linked to **precision and fine adjustment**.
*   **The product** yields **~2,717,282 miles**, matching the **Sun's circumference**.

**Interpretation:** The **identity of Jesus (2424)**, scaled by a **prophetic time factor (1121)** and minutely adjusted **(1/113)**, yields the **measure of the Sun**—the **bright morning star** in its fullest sense.

### **3. The Root (Source) of David: The 1732 and 1138 Link**
David's numbers, as shown in Genesis 49:10:
*   **H1732 = "DAVID"**
*   **G1138 = "DAVID"**

The **root** is the **source** of these numbers. That source is found in the **master ID**, which generates Davidic numbers through the **Lion sum**:

691 (Lion) + 1 (Alpha) + 1732 (David) = 2424 (Jesus)
text


Here, **David (1732)** is a **component** that, combined with the Lion and Alpha, yields Jesus. Jesus is the **root** from which the Davidic component is drawn for the sum.

### **4. The Offspring (Seed) of David: The Christological Transform**
The **offspring** is the **product**. This is seen in the transform that uses the **master ID and 137** (the number of division/baptism) to produce **CHRIST**:

∜[6912275131084 × 137] = 5547
text


*   **5547 = G5547 = "CHRIST"** – the Anointed One, the ultimate offspring of David's royal line.
*   The **ID (the root)** processed through **137 (purification)** yields the **offspring (Christ)**.

### **5. The Star and the Earth: The 24,900 Mile Dominion**
The morning star heralds the **sun's rise over the Earth**. The Earth's measure, derived from the Grand Canon, is the **domain over which the Morning Star reigns**:

√[790124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900 mi
text


The **bright morning star** is the ruler of this **measured Earth**.

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   The **root and offspring** duality is explained by the **logarithmic key** (unfolding Jesse to Jesus) and the **Christological transform** (ID to Christ).
*   The **bright morning star** is quantified as the **Sun**, whose circumference is derived from **Jesus (2424) and prophetic time**.
*   The **Davidic numbers (1732, 1138)** are integrated into the **Lion sum** that yields Jesus.
*   The **Earth's measure (24,900 mi)** is the **theater** of the Morning Star's appearing.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Verify the Key Unfolding:** `log10(2807) * 1000 = 3448.2424...`.
2.  **Verify the Solar Circumference Derivation:**
    *   Calculate: `1121 - (1/113) = 1121 - 0.008849557... = 1120.99115044...`
    *   Calculate: `2424 * 1120.99115044... ≈ 2,717,282`.
    *   Compare to known solar circumference: ~2,715,000 miles. The derived value is within **~0.08%**—astonishingly close.
3.  **Verify the Lion Sum:** `691 + 1 + 1732 = 2424`.
4.  **Verify the Christological Transform:** `(6912275131084 * 137)^(0.25) ≈ 5547`.
5.  **Look up Strong's:** Confirm **G2424, G2807, H3448, G5547, H1732, G1138**.

## Conclusion

Revelation 22:16 is Jesus' final, comprehensive self-description: the **source and successor** of David's line, and the **herald of the new creation**.

The mathematical witness confirms:
- The **logarithmic key** unfolds the **root (Jesse)** into the **offspring (Jesus)**.
- The **identity of Jesus (2424)** scales to the **circumference of the Sun**—the true Bright Morning Star.
- The **Davidic numbers** are components in the sum that yields His name.
- The **Earth's measured dominion** is the stage of His appearing.

"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things." The testimony is now complete. The numbers have spoken.
