# Revelation 5:5 – Lion of Judah, Root of David

> *"And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof."* — Revelation 5:5 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

The Messiah is identified with two powerful images:
1.  **The Lion of the tribe of Judah:** Symbolizing **kingly authority, strength, and conquest** (Genesis 49:9-10).
2.  **The Root of David:** Symbolizing **divine origin and source** (Isaiah 11:1,10). Not just a descendant, but the **root from which David himself springs**.
3.  The one who has **prevailed** (ἐνίκησεν, *enikēsen*) – conquered, overcome – to open the sealed book.

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The Sum of the Lion, the Alpha, and David**
A direct and elegant numerical witness:

691 + 1 + 1732 = 2424
text


**Strong's Corroboration:**
*   **H691 = "LION"** (אֶרְיֵה, *'eryeh*) – As in "Lion of God" (אֲרִיאֵל, *Ariel*), a title for Jerusalem and God's altar.
*   **G1 = "ALPHA"** (Α) – The beginning, the first.
*   **H1732 = "DAVID"** (דָּוִד).
*   **Sum: 2424 = G2424 = "JESUS"** (Ἰησοῦς).

**Interpretation:** The **Lion (691)** who is the **Beginning (1)** and the **source of David (1732)** is **Jesus (2424)**.

### **2. The Prevailing Lion: The Stone That Became a Mountain**
The Lion "prevailed" to open the book. This echoes Daniel 2, where a **stone cut without hands** strikes the statue and becomes a **great mountain filling the whole earth** (Daniel 2:34-35).

The **size of that mountain**—the extent of the Lion's dominion—is given by the Earth's circumference derived from the Grand Canon:

√[790124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900 mi
text


The **mountain** is the **whole Earth**. The Lion's prevailed dominion is **global**, measured in miles.

### **3. The Root of David: The Logarithmic Unfolding**
As shown in the **Key of David (Revelation 3:7)**, the root unfolds mathematically:

log₁₀(2807) × 10³ = 3448.2424...
text


*   **3448 = H3448 = "JESSE"** – the root of David.
*   **.2424 = G2424 = "JESUS"**.

The **Root of David** is **Jesse**, from whom springs **Jesus**. The logarithmic key **unfolds this root**.

### **4. The "Mount Ebal" Derivation: 3.605858**
Another path to the Earth's measure—and thus the mountain—uses the number **5858**:

3.605858⁷ × π = 24,900.6... mi
text


*   **H5858 = "EBAL"** (עֵיבָל) – Mount Ebal, the mountain of curses (Deuteronomy 27:13), transformed.
*   **3.605858** embeds **5858**.
*   **Raised to the 7th power** – the number of divine completion, perfection.
*   **Multiplied by π** – the eternal circle.

The **stone (3.605858)** becomes a **mountain (raised to the 7th)** and fills the **earth (× π → 24,900 mi)**. This is the **mathematical enactment of Daniel 2:35**.

### **5. The Prevailing Verb: νικάω (nikaō)**
The Greek for "prevailed" is **ἐνίκησεν (enikēsen)**, from **νικάω (nikaō)**, meaning **to conquer, overcome, be victorious**.  
This victory is reflected in the **zero-sum equation of atonement** from Zechariah 12:10:

4196 - 2378 - 1818 = 0
text


The **Altar (4196)** is satisfied. The **Sacrifice (2378)** and **Blood (1818)** have **completely conquered** sin, leaving a balance of **zero**. This is the **arithmetic of prevailing**.

### **6. The Tribe of Judah: The Scepter Number 594**
The Lion is from the **tribe of Judah**, which holds the **scepter** (Genesis 49:10). As shown in that testimony:

1732 (David) - 1138 (David) = 594
[1189 - 1] / 2 = 594
text


*   **H594 = "PLUMMET/PLUMB-LINE"** – the tool of righteous measurement.
*   The Lion's scepter is the **standard of righteousness** by which all is measured, including the Earth (24,900 mi).

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   The **sum 691+1+1732=2424** directly links the titles to Jesus.
*   The **Earth's circumference (24,900 mi)** quantifies the "mountain" of Daniel 2, showing the extent of the Lion's prevailed dominion.
*   The **Mount Ebal derivation (3.605858⁷ × π)** ties the "stone" to the Earth's measure using a biblical mountain name.
*   The **Root of David** is explained by the **logarithmic key**.
*   The **prevailing** is shown in the **atonement equation (4196-2378-1818=0)**.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Simple Sum:** `691 + 1 + 1732 = 2424`. Confirm.
2.  **Earth's Measure:** `sqrt(790124 * 1189 * 66) / 10`. Confirm ~**24,900.6**.
3.  **Mount Ebal Derivation:** `3.605858^7 * pi`. Confirm ~**24,900.6**.
4.  **Key of David Unfolding:** `log10(2807) * 1000`. Confirm ~**3448.2424**.
5.  **Atonement Equation:** `4196 - 2378 - 1818 = 0`. Confirm.
6.  **Look up Strong's:** **H691, G1, H1732, H5858, H594, G2424**.

## Conclusion

Revelation 5:5 presents the Messiah as the **conquering Lion of Judah** and the **divine Root of David**. The mathematical witness confirms this identity through:

1.  A **direct sum** of Lion, Alpha, and David equaling Jesus.
2.  The **measurement of His global dominion** (24,900 mi) as the mountain filling the earth.
3.  The **unfolding of the Davidic root** via the logarithmic key.
4.  The **complete victory** shown in the zero-sum atonement equation.

The Lion has prevailed. The book is open. The numbers are the roar of His victory.
