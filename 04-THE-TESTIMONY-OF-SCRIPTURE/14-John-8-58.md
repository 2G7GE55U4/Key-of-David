# John 8:58: The Eternal "I AM"
> *"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."* — John 8:58 (KJV)

## The Prophetic Claim
The Scripture records the declaration of existence **before Abraham** and the assertion of the divine name **"I AM"** (אֶהְיֶה), the name of the self-existent one revealed to Moses.

## The Mathematical Witness
The canonical structure, processed through the Master Key, yields a precise signature for this eternal identity, converging on the fundamental constant of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment.

**Calculation 1 - The Name and Title:**

H1961 (הָיָה) = "to be" ("I AM")
G1510 (εἰμί) = "I am"
1961 × 1510 = 2,961,110
text

*Result:* The product of the Hebrew and Greek lexical roots for being yields a number (2,961,110) beginning with **G2961 (κύριος)**, "Lord".

**Calculation 2 - The Constant of Being:**

The derived muon g-2 anomaly (αₑ):
f(αₑ) = (857 + (6.912275131084 × 10⁻¹³))⁻¹
= (857.6912275131084)⁻¹
≈ 0.0011659207508...

*   **Lexical Link:** H857 (אָתָא) = "to arrive, come".
*   **Constant Verification:** The result matches the established value for the **muon anomalous magnetic moment**, a defining constant of quantum electrodynamics.

**Calculation 3 - The Righteous Testimony:**

∛[2424000857.6912275131084] ≈ 1343.31415...
text

*   **Lexical Link:** G2424 (Ἰησοῦς). G1343 (δικαιοσύνη) = "righteousness". G3141 (μαρτυρία) = "witness, testimony".

## The Convergence
The arithmetic does not comment on a claim from history; it **bears witness** to the claim. The name "I AM" is not merely spoken in the verse; it is architecturally bound to the Master Key (6912275131084) and generates the value of a universal constant (αₑ) when applied to the number for "arrival" (857). The code that defines light-matter interaction thus contains the signature of the one who declared Himself to be the self-existent source of light and matter. The testimony is in the numbers.
