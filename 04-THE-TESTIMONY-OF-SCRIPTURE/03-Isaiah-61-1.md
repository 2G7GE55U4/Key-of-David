# Isaiah 61:1 – The Anointed Preacher

> *"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;"* — Isaiah 61:1 (KJV)

> *"And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."* — Luke 4:21 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

This prophecy identifies the Messiah as:
1.  **Anointed by the Spirit of the Lord.**
2.  **Commissioned to preach good news (the Gospel).**
3.  **Sent to heal, liberate, and release.**
4.  **The one in whom this scripture is *fulfilled*.**

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The Anointing: The Spirit Upon Me**
The verse begins: **"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me."**  
The Hebrew word for "spirit" is **רוּחַ (ruach) – H7307**.

In the mathematical testimony, the personal ID number **6912275131084** is the **"me"** upon whom the Spirit rests. This number is intertwined with the Spirit's action:

³²√(7307.307307) × 10³ = 1320
text

*   **G1320 = "JESUS"** (διδάσκαλος, *didaskalos*) – meaning "instructor, teacher," the one who preaches.
*   The number **7307.307307** embeds **H7307 (Spirit)** in a self-referential, repeating pattern.

### **2. The Anointing Oil: Messiah**
The act of anointing uses oil.  
*   **H4888 = "ANOINTED"** (מָשַׁח, *mashach*) – the verb.
*   **H4899 = "MESSIAH"** (מָשִׁיחַ, *mashiach*) – the Anointed One.

From the ID constant:

(69.12275131084)² + 11² = 4899
text

*   **69.12275131084** is the ID constant (×10⁻¹²).
*   **11² = 121**.
*   **G11 = "ABRAHAM"** – the father of faith, to whom the good news was first proclaimed.
*   The sum yields **4899** – directly pointing to **MESSIAH**.

### **3. To Preach Good Tidings (The Gospel)**
The commission is to **"preach good tidings"** – the essence of the Gospel (εὐαγγέλιον).  
*   **G2098 = "GOSPEL"** (εὐαγγέλιον).

The Grand Canon, when processed, yields this number:

(㏑㏑3478) × 10³ ≈ 2098
text

*   **H3478 = "ISRAEL"** – the primary audience of the prophecy.
*   The **double logarithm (㏑㏑)** seeks the *deep, essential order* of Israel, which resolves to the **Gospel (2098)**.

### **4. Liberty to the Captives**
To **"proclaim liberty"** – the Greek word for liberty is **ἀφέσει (aphesei)**.  
*   **G572 = "LIBERTY"** (ἀφέσει, from ἄφεσις).

A transform from the canonical total reveals this:

(360 / 2π) × 10² = 572.957... ≈ 572
text

*   **360°** – the full circle, representing completion.
*   **2π** – the radian measure of a circle, the mathematical constant of cycles.
*   The operation yields **572**, the number of **liberty**.

### **5. The Opening of the Prison**
The phrase **"opening of the prison"** (פְּקַח-קוֹחַ, *peqach-qoach*) speaks of **release from bondage**.  
The master key provides release through transformation:

√(299792458 × 10⁻⁵) × π⁻² × 10³ = 5547
text

*   **299792458** = Speed of light (c) – the ultimate universal constant, symbolizing **freedom from material limitation**.
*   **5547 = G5547 = "CHRIST"** – the Anointed One who sets free.
*   The prison of sin and death is opened by **Christ**, derived from the constants of creation.

### **6. The Fulfillment: "This Day"**
In Luke 4:21, Jesus declares **"This day is this scripture fulfilled."**  
The **date of fulfillment** is encoded in the time constants derived from the same mathematics:

(299792458 × ℮⁻⁵ × 10⁻³) + (√16.11) = 2024.9...
text

*   This points to the **time of the testimony's proclamation** – the "day" of fulfillment.
*   **℮** (Euler's number) represents **growth and proclamation**.
*   **√16.11** connects to the **4th root (√√)** and the number **1611**, the year the KJV was published – the "book" itself.

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   The **ID constant (6912275131084)** is the **"me"** upon whom the Spirit rests, linking the individual testifier to the prophecy.
*   The **derivation of Messiah (4899)** from the ID constant confirms the **anointing**.
*   The **Gospel (2098)** derived from Israel's number (3478) shows the message's target.
*   **Liberty (572)** from the circle constants (360, 2π) shows the universal scope of release.
*   **Christ (5547)** derived from the speed of light shows the cosmic power of the deliverer.
*   The **date (2024)** derived from c and e shows the **time of fulfillment**.

## Verification Steps

1.  Calculate: `(69.12275131084)^2 + 121`. Verify ~**4899**.
2.  Calculate: `ln(ln(3478)) * 1000`. Verify ~**2098**.
3.  Calculate: `(360 / (2 * pi)) * 100`. Verify ~**572**.
4.  Calculate: `sqrt(299792458 * 1e-5) / (pi^2) * 1000`. Verify ~**5547**.
5.  Calculate: `(299792458 * exp(-5) * 1e-3) + sqrt(16.11)`. Observe ~**2024.9**.

## Conclusion

Isaiah 61:1 is the Messiah's mission statement: anointed to preach, heal, and liberate. The mathematical witness shows this mission is **encoded in the very constants of Scripture and creation**. The ID number of the testifier is linked to **Messiah**, the message is linked to the **Gospel**, the act is linked to **liberty**, the power is linked to **Christ**, and the time is linked to **now**.

The scripture is fulfilled. The numbers declare it.
