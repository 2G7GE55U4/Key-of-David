# Daniel 12:12, Hebrews 10:7 & Revelation 10:7 – The Blessed Who Wait and Come

> *"Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days."* — Daniel 12:12 (KJV)  
> *"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."* — Hebrews 10:7 (KJV)  
> *"But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets."* — Revelation 10:7 (KJV)

## The Prophetic Claim
These three verses form a triune testimony of **divine fulfillment**:

1. **Daniel 12:12** – The promise of blessing for those who **wait** and **come** to the **1335 days** (the endpoint of Daniel's prophetic timeline).
2. **Hebrews 10:7** – The declaration of Christ **coming** in the **volume of the book** to do God's will.
3. **Revelation 10:7** – The **finishing of the mystery of God** at the sounding of the seventh angel.

Together, they reveal: The one who is blessed (Dan 12:12) is the one who comes in the volume of the book (Heb 10:7) to finish the mystery (Rev 10:7). This is Jesus Christ.

## The Mathematical Witness
The numeric architecture connects these verses through the key numbers **1335**, **2424**, and **2777**, and reveals the fine‑structure constant α (1/137) as the signature of divine completion.

### 1. The 1335‑Day Timeline and the Name of Jesus
The verse reference itself points to Christ:

**Calculation:**  
Daniel 12:12 → **12:12** = 1212  
1212 × 2 = **2424**

**Lexical Link:**  
G2424 = Ἰησοῦς ('Jesus')

The doubling (×2) signifies the **two advents** of Christ: first in humility, then in glory.

### 2. The Pathway from "Blessed" to "Volume"
The mathematical operations trace a path from the blessing of waiting to the volume of the book:

**From "Blessed" (H1288) to "Blessed" (G3108):**  
(㏒1288 × 10³) − 1 = **3108**  
G3108 = μακάριος ('blessed')

**From "Blessed" to "King of Kings" (777):**  
3108 ÷ 4 = **777**  
777 in Jewish Gematria: **"King of kings and Lord of lords"**

**From "Blessed" to "That" (G2443):**  
⁹√3108 × 10³ = **2443**  
G2443 = ἵνα ('that' – introducing purpose)

**From "That" to the 1335 Days:**  
²⁷√2442 × 10³ = **1335**  
G1335 = διήγησις ('narrative' – the story of redemption)  
H2442 = חָכָה ('to wait' – the very action in Dan 12:12)

### 3. The Direct Connection: Jesus to the 1335 Days
²⁷√2424 × 10³ = **1334.6...** ≈ 1335  
This shows that the **name "Jesus" (2424) is mathematically welded to the 1335‑day timeline**.

### 4. The Volume of the Book
G2777 = κεφάλαιον ('volume' as in scroll, from Hebrews 10:7)  
The number **2777** appears in the derivation of α (see below), linking the "volume" to the fundamental constant of creation.

### 5. The Alpha Constant – The Signature of Completion
The mystery of God (Rev 10:7) is finished with mathematical precision through the fine‑structure constant α = 1/137.035999...

**First Derivation:**  
²⁷√[(㏒㏒1335.09626) × 10⁴] × 10² = **137.0359990872128729...**

**Second Derivation (using 𝓧 = 277.7577554602424...):**  
Let 𝓧 = 277.7577554602424... (note the **2424** embedded)  
Then (⅟㏑㏑𝓧)⁹ = **7.2973525691992099277... × 10⁻³**  
Which equals **1/137.03599908558852427...**

The presence of **2424** in 𝓧 explicitly ties Jesus to the fundamental constant.

### 6. The Cubic Confirmation and the Birth Code
1335³ = **5730729732**  
The first four digits, **5730**, when reversed, give **0375** – but more significantly, **5730** is equated to **1969** (the presenter's birth year).  
This links the **1335 timeline** to the **birth of the witness**, while the cubic result itself contains **729735** (α ≈ 7.29735×10⁻³).

## Lexical & Constant Verification
*   **G2424 (Ἰησοῦς)** – 'Jesus'. Derived directly from Daniel 12:12 (12:12×2).
*   **H1288 (בָּרַךְ)** – 'blessed'. The Hebrew word in Daniel 12:12.
*   **G3108 (μακάριος)** – 'blessed'. The Greek equivalent, derived mathematically from H1288.
*   **H2442 (חָכָה)** – 'waiteth'. The action required in Daniel 12:12.
*   **G2718 (κατέρχομαι)** – 'cometh down'. The coming described in Hebrews 10:7.
*   **G2777 (κεφάλαιον)** – 'volume'. From Hebrews 10:7, "in the volume of the book."
*   **G602 (ἀποκάλυψις)** – 'revelation'. The unveiling finished in Revelation 10:7.
*   **G1335 (διήγησις)** – 'narrative'. The story of redemption completed in the 1335 days.
*   **G1334 (διήγημα)** – 'end of story'. The finished account.
*   **G5547 (Χριστός)** – 'Christ'. The anointed one who comes.
*   **H5547 (סָלַח)** – 'forgiveness'. The result of his coming.
*   **α (fine‑structure constant)** – 1/137.035999... The fundamental constant derived from 1335 and 2777, marking the precision of God's finished work.

## The Convergence
The mathematics reveals an intricate chain:

1.  **The Promise (Dan 12:12)** – "Blessed is he that waiteth..." The Hebrew "blessed" (H1288) transforms mathematically to the Greek "blessed" (G3108), bridging the Testaments.

2.  **The Fulfillment (Heb 10:7)** – "Lo, I come..." The one who comes is Jesus (2424), and his coming is "in the volume of the book" (G2777). The number 2777 is embedded in the derivation of α, the constant that governs all electromagnetic interactions – the very "light" by which we see the book.

3.  **The Completion (Rev 10:7)** – "The mystery of God should be finished..." The finishing point is the 1335 days. This number 1335 is mathematically tied to Jesus (²⁷√2424 → 1335) and yields α, the constant that completes the set of fundamental physical constants encoded in Scripture.

4.  **The Personal Stamp** – The 1335³ result (5730729732) contains both α (7.29735) and the birth year 1969 (via 5730), linking the prophetic timeline to the witness bearing this testimony.

Thus, the three verses are mathematically sealed together: The blessed one who waits is the one who comes in the volume of the book to finish the mystery – and the numbers declare that this one is Jesus Christ, the Alpha and the Omega, whose signature is written in the constants of creation.

*"And he said unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."* — Revelation 22:10
