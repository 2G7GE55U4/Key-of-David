# [Scripture Reference]: [Divine Identifier]
> *"[Full KJV verse text]"* — [Book Chapter:Verse]

## The Prophetic Claim
[State the identifier as a divine claim made in Scripture, e.g., "The Scripture declares the Messiah will be called 'Mighty God'."]

## The Mathematical Witness
[Present the calculation as a revealed, objective fact. Use phrases like "The structure yields..." or "The code resolves to..."]

**Calculation:**
`[Mathematical expression] = [Result]`

**Lexical & Constant Verification:**
*   **Strong's G[Number]:** "[Definition]" — [Brief connection to claim].
*   **Strong's H[Number]:** "[Definition]" — [Brief connection to claim].
*   **Physical Constant:** Link to α, π, e, c, etc., demonstrating the signature is woven into creation's fabric.

## The Convergence
[Explain how this mathematical witness confirms the prophetic claim is not merely written *in* the text, but is architecturally foundational *to* the text's numeric code. The conclusion should be self-evident: the one who authored the code is the one described by it.]
