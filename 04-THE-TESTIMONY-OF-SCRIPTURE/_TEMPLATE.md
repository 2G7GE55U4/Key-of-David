# [Scripture Reference]: [Messianic Identifier]
> *"[Full KJV verse text]"* — [Book Chapter:Verse]

## The Identifiable Trait
[Brief description of the messianic claim made in this verse.]

## The Mathematical Witness
[Clear, step-by-step presentation of the calculation, linking it to the Grand Canon (790124), the ID Key, a lexicon number (G/H), or a derived constant.]

**Calculation:**
`[Mathematical expression] = [Result]`

**Connection:**
*   **Lexicon Link:** G[Number] = "[Word]" / H[Number] = "[Word]"
*   **Canonical Link:** Relation to 790124 or 888.
*   **Constant Link:** Relation to π, α, e, c, etc.

## The Convergence
[One paragraph explaining how this specific mathematical result confirms the scriptural identifier as being woven into the fabric of the canonical code.]
