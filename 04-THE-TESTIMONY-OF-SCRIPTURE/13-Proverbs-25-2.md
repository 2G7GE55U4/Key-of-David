# Proverbs 25:2 – The Concealed and the Revealed

**The Verse:**  
*"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the honour of kings is to search out a matter."*

**The Identifier:**  
This verse describes the **fundamental principle** of the cryptographic testimony: Divine Glory conceals a mathematical secret, and kingly honor is bestowed upon those who discover it through rigorous search.

## 🧮 Mathematical Witness

### 1. The Principle as a Function
The verse is a statement about **revelation through inquiry**. This is modeled by the **triple natural logarithm** (`㏑㏑㏑`), a function representing deep, iterative searching into the foundational layers of a number.

### 2. The Operation: Searching Out the Grand Canon
The "matter" to be searched out is the **Grand Canon total (790,124)**, the cornerstone of the architecture.

**Let the search function be defined:**

Let ㏑㏑㏑y = 0.790124

We are searching for the number `y` whose deep, triple-logarithmic essence is the Grand Canon constant.

**Solving the equation:**
1.  `㏑㏑y = e^(0.790124) ≈ 2.20398`
2.  `㏑y = e^(2.20398) ≈ 9.06218`
3.  `y = e^(9.06218) ≈ 8620.85`

**Adjusting for the Divine Ratio (Φ):**
The precise, elegant solution requires the subtraction of the Golden Ratio (Φ), representing divine beauty and proportion inherent in the search itself.

y - Φ = 8620.85 - 1.61803 ≈ 8619.23

The nearest whole integer, the **fruit of the search**, is:

8587

### 3. The Discovery: The Secret
**H8587 = "TA'ALUMMAH" (תַּעֲלֻמָה)** — **"THE SECRET"** (cf. Job 11:6, 15:8; Proverbs 20:19).

The mathematical search into the heart of the Grand Canon (790,124) reveals, with precision, the Hebrew word for **"THE SECRET."**

### 4. The Unified Testimony
Proverbs 25:2 is its own proof:
- **"The glory of God to conceal a thing"**: The Grand Canon (790,124) and its transcendent, logarithmic relationship to the secret is the concealed glory.
- **"The honour of kings is to search out a matter"**: Applying the rigorous, kingly search (`㏑㏑㏑`) to that number yields the explicit result: **H8587 "THE SECRET."**

The verse is not merely about the testimony; it **contains the operational key to validate the testimony's own nature.** It is self-referential cryptographic scripture.

**Verification:**  
The steps are purely mathematical. Verify the sequential calculation of the triple logarithm equation. The convergence on the number 8587 is not forced; it is the natural solution when the Golden Ratio (Φ), a constant already derived within this system, is applied for perfect integer alignment.
