# Zechariah 12:10 – The Pierced One

> *"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn."* — Zechariah 12:10 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

This prophecy identifies the Messiah as:
1.  **Pierced** (דָּקָרוּ, *daqaru*) – a violent, physical piercing.
2.  The one upon whom **the Spirit of grace and supplications** is poured.
3.  The object of **national mourning** as for an only son or firstborn.
4.  The **"me"** who speaks (Yahweh) is identified with the **"him"** who is pierced – a clear claim of divinity.

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The Equation of Atonement: Altar – Sacrifice – Blood = 0**
The most direct mathematical witness is a perfect, zero-sum equation:

4196 - 2378 - 1818 = 0
text


**Strong's Corroboration:**
*   **H4196 = "ALTAR"** (מִזְבֵּחַ, *mizbeach*) – The place of offering.
*   **G2378 = "SACRIFICE"** (θυσία, *thysia*) – The offering slain.
*   **H1818 = "BLOOD"** (דָּם, *dam*) – The life poured out.

**Theological Meaning:** The **Altar (4196)**, minus the **Sacrifice (2378)**, minus the **Blood (1818)**, leaves **zero**.  
This is the mathematical statement of **complete, exhaustive atonement**. The debt is paid in full. Nothing remains.

### **2. The Cubic Volume of the Sacrifice**
The sacrifice is not just subtracted; it has a **defined volume** that multiplies to the identity of Christ:

237.8³ ≈ 2424 × 5547
text

*   **237.8** is the decimal form of **G2378 = "SACRIFICE"**.
*   **2424 = G2424 = "JESUS"**.
*   **5547 = G5547 = "CHRIST"**.

**Interpretation:** The **cubic volume** (a complete, three-dimensional measure) of the **Sacrifice** is equal to the product of **JESUS** and **CHRIST**. The sacrifice is **fully quantified** by the person and office of the Messiah.

### **3. The Piercing and the Pouring of Spirit**
The prophecy begins: **"I will pour upon... the spirit of grace."**  
The Hebrew for "pour" is שָׁפַךְ (*shaphak*), closely associated with **pouring out blood** (Isaiah 53:12) and **pouring out spirit** (Joel 2:28-29).

The mathematical link between spirit and the pierced one is seen in the **double root of the ID**:

∜[6912275131084 × √25] = 2424.6427...
text

*   **√25 = 5** – Number of grace.
*   **2424** – Jesus.
*   **.6427** – H6427 = "AFFRIGHT" (פַּחַד, *pachad*) – terror, trembling, the reaction to the piercing.
*   The operation shows **grace (5)** applied to the key yields **Jesus**, with a remainder of **holy fear**.

### **4. They Shall Look Upon Me**
The speaker (Yahweh) says **"they shall look upon ME whom they have pierced."**  
The act of "looking" (הִבִּיט, *hibbît*) implies recognition, understanding. This is the **verification** step of the proof. The numbers allow us to **"look upon"** the pierced one and recognize Him.

The verification is in the **mathematical gaze** at the equation `4196 - 2378 - 1818 = 0`. When you look upon this operation, you see the completed work.

### **5. Mourning as for an Only Son**
The mourning is **"as for an only son"** (כְּאֵבֶל עַל הַיָּחִיד).  
The numeric value of **"only son"** (יָחִיד, *yachid*) resonates with the number **1** – unique, singular.  
The master key is itself a **singular, unique constant** (`0.6912275131084`) that generates the identity of the Son.

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   The **Atonement Equation (4196-2378-1818=0)** is a standalone, irrefutable proof of the sacrificial system's fulfillment.
*   It integrates with the **Christological transforms** (237.8³ → 2424×5547), linking the sacrifice directly to Jesus Christ.
*   The **pouring of spirit** connects to the **grace (5)** in the transform operation.
*   The **"looking"** is fulfilled by the **act of verifying the arithmetic**.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Primary Proof:** Calculate `4196 - 2378 - 1818`. Confirm it equals **0**.
2.  **Secondary Proof:** Calculate `237.8^3`. Result: `~13,445,000`.  
    Calculate `2424 * 5547`. Result: `~13,448,328`.  
    Observe the close agreement (~0.02% difference, within rounding of 237.8).
3.  **Look up Strong's:** Confirm **H4196, G2378, H1818, G2424, G5547**.
4.  **Conceptual Verification:** Meditate on the theological meaning of the equation. The altar is empty. The sacrifice is complete. The blood has been accepted.

## Conclusion

Zechariah 12:10 prophesies a piercing that is both a human crime and a divine provision. The mathematical witness presents this as a **completed transaction in the language of numbers**.

The equation `4196 - 2378 - 1818 = 0` is the arithmetic of "**It is finished**" (John 19:30). The altar is satisfied. The sacrifice is consumed. The blood has been shed.

They shall look upon Him whom they pierced. And when they look with the eyes of mathematics, they see a balance of zero—a debt paid in full, leaving nothing but grace.
