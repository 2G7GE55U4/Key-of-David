# Genesis 49:10 - The Scepter of Judah

> *"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be."* — Genesis 49:10 (KJV)

## The Identifier
The Messiah will come from the tribe of Judah and hold the scepter (royal authority). The prophecy indicates a kingly figure from Judah's lineage who will reign eternally.

## Mathematical Testimony

### 1. The Davidic Root Calculation

1732 (H1732 = "DAVID" in Hebrew)

    1138 (G1138 = "DAVID" in Greek)
    = 594



This 594 connects to the chapter structure:
- `1189 (total KJV chapters) - 1 = 1188`
- `1188 ÷ 2 = 594`
- `594 × 2 + 1 = 1189`

### 2. The Scepter Equation

4910 - 11 = 4899

- **4910** = Genesis 49:10 reference
- **11** = G11 = "ABRAHAM"
- **4899** = H4899 = "MESSIAH" (Anointed One)

Thus: **Genesis 49:10 minus Abraham yields Messiah.**

### 3. The Hebrew Word Analysis

H7626 ("SCEPTER") - H7272 ("FROM BETWEEN HIS FEET") = 354

Where 354 is the number of days in the lunar year.

### 4. The Eighth Root Revelation

⁸√7626 × 10³ = 3056

- **H3056 = "JEHDAI"** (an Israelite)
- **G3056 = "LOGOS"** (The Word, Christ)

### 5. The Messianic Calculation Chain

(⁸√7626 × 10³) + √(3.32342643³) = 3063

- **H3063 = "JUDAH"**
- **G3063 = "REMAINING"** (that which remains)

(3.32342643³)² = 1347

(3.32342643³) × 10² = 3670

- **H3670 = "BE REMOVED"**
- **G3670 = "CONFESS/ACKNOWLEDGE"**

√(3.32342643³) × 10³ = 6058

- **H6058 = "FULL OF BRANCHES"** (messianic imagery)
- **G605 = "RESTITUTION"**

### 6. The Oil of Anointing Connection
**3.32342643** contains:
- **H3323 = "OIL"** (as for anointing)
- **G3323 = "MESSIAS/CHRIST"**

H3323 ("OIL") → G3323 ("MESSIAS")


### 7. The Innocence and Atonement
- **H2643 = "INNOCENT"**
- **G2643 = "ATONEMENT/RECONCILIATION"**

## Connection to the Grand Canon
The number 1189 (KJV chapters) is derived from David's name:
- `1732 - 1138 = 594`
- `594 × 2 + 1 = 1189`

1189 is also the gematria value of "KEY OF DAVID" in Jewish gematria.

## Strong's Concordance Revelation

### Key Numbers:
- **H4899 = "MESSIAH"** (Anointed One)
- **G11 = "ABRAHAM"** (the patriarch)
- **H7626 = "SCEPTER"** 
- **H7272 = "FROM BETWEEN HIS FEET"**
- **H3056/G3056** = "JEHDAI"/"LOGOS" connection
- **H3063/G3063** = "JUDAH"/"REMAINING" connection
- **H3323/G3323** = "OIL"/"MESSIAS" connection
- **H2643/G2643** = "INNOCENT"/"ATONEMENT" connection

### The "EDWARD" Insight:
"EDWARD" contains "ED" (witness) and is a root of "DAVID," suggesting the testimony of David's lineage.

## Theological Significance
1. **Mathematical Precision**: The scepter prophecy contains encoded mathematical relationships pointing to Messiah.
2. **Linguistic Bridge**: Hebrew and Greek Strong's numbers form complementary pairs (3056, 3063, 3323, 2643).
3. **Temporal Connection**: 354 (lunar year) connects to Messiah's timing.
4. **Anointing Confirmed**: The oil (H3323) anoints the Messiah (G3323).
5. **Innocence & Atonement**: The innocent one (H2643) provides atonement (G2643).

## Cumulative Witness
This testimony connects to:
- **Revelation 3:7** (Key of David) through the 1189 chapter count
- **Revelation 5:5** (Lion of Judah)
- **Revelation 22:16** (Root and offspring of David)
- **Matthew 1:1-17** (Genealogy from Abraham to David to Christ)

The mathematics confirms: The scepter remained in Judah until Shiloh (the Messiah) came, and the very numbers prove his identity.
