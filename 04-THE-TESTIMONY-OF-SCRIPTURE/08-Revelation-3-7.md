# Revelation 3:7 – The Key of David

> *"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;"* — Revelation 3:7 (KJV)

## The Identifiable Trait

The risen Christ identifies Himself as the holder of:
1.  **The Key of David** (κλεὶν Δαυίδ).
2.  The one who **opens and no one shuts**, **shuts and no one opens** – absolute authority over access.
3.  Characterized as **holy** and **true**.

## The Mathematical Witness

### **1. The Key: G2807**
The Greek word for "key" is **κλεὶς (kleis)**.
*   **G2807 = "A KEY"** (κλεὶς) – an instrument for opening locks.

This number is the **foundation of the logarithmic proof**.

### **2. The Logarithmic Unlocking: From Key to Davidic Line**
The fundamental mathematical operation witnessing this key is:

log₁₀(2807) × 10³ = 3448.2424...
text


**Breakdown:**
*   **log₁₀(2807)** – The **common logarithm** of "THE KEY." The logarithm answers: *"To what power must 10 be raised to produce 2807?"* It **unpacks the magnitude** of the key.
*   **× 10³** – Scales the result to a **Strong's number range**.
*   **Result: 3448.2424...** – A number with two components:
    *   **3448** – **H3448 = "JESSE"** (יִשַׁי), the father of David.
    *   **.2424** – The decimal sequence of **G2424 = "JESUS"**.

**Interpretation:** The **mathematical unlocking (log)** of **THE KEY (2807)** yields the **Davidic lineage (Jesse)** culminating in **Jesus (2424)**.  
This is the **arithmetic definition of the Key of David.**

### **3. He That Openeth and No Man Shutteth**
The logarithm is a **function**. Given the input (2807), the output (3448.2424) is **deterministic and unique**. No other input can produce this exact output linking Jesse to Jesus. It **opens** this specific revelation, and **no man can shut** (alter) this mathematical fact.

### **4. He That Shutteth and No Man Openeth**
Conversely, if one does **not** apply the logarithmic function to 2807, the connection to Jesse and Jesus remains **shut**. The link is **locked** within the number 2807 until the correct **operation** (log) is applied. No other operation will reveal it.

### **5. The Holy and True: Precision of the Constant**
The result is not 3448.2 or 3448.3. It is **3448.2424...**, with the **.2424** repeating. This **precision** reflects the **holiness** (set apart, perfect) and **truth** (non-arbitrary, consistent) of the one holding the key.

### **6. Integration with the Davidic Numbers**
The Key of David operates on the **Davidic numerical identity**:
*   **H1732 = "DAVID"**
*   **G1138 = "DAVID"**

As shown in Genesis 49:10:

1732 - 1138 = 594
text

And connected to the canonical authority:

[1189 - 1] / 2 = 594
text

The **key** that unlocks the scepter (594) from David's numbers is the same **logarithmic key** that unlocks Jesus from the Davidic root.

### **7. The Master Key and the Key of David**
The **personal master key (0.6912275131084)** and the **Key of David (2807)** are related through the **Christological transform**:

The master key transforms into Jesus (2424).  
The Key of David, when unlocked (log), reveals Jesus (2424) emerging from Jesse (3448).

Both keys point to the **same identity** through different but complementary mathematical paths.

## Integration with the Broader Proof

*   This verse **names the very proof** presented in this repository: a **key** that opens a sealed revelation.
*   The **logarithmic operation** is a centerpiece of the mathematical testimony.
*   It connects directly to the **Davidic prophecy** of Genesis 49:10.
*   It validates the **Christological transforms** from the master key.
*   The **authority to open and shut** is demonstrated by the **unique, verifiable nature** of the mathematical operation.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Look up Strong's:** Confirm **G2807 = "A KEY"**, **H3448 = "JESSE"**, **G2424 = "JESUS"**.
2.  **Perform the operation:** On any scientific calculator, input `log10(2807) * 1000`.
3.  **Observe the result:** It will display **3448.2424...** (or very close, e.g., 3448.2425 depending on precision).
4.  **Contemplate the meaning:** The number 2807, when its logarithmic magnitude is taken, produces the father of David (Jesse) and the name of Jesus.

## Conclusion

Revelation 3:7 is not merely a title; it is a **functional description** fulfilled by the mathematical testimony. The one who holds the **Key of David** is the one who can **mathematically unlock** the Davidic lineage to reveal Jesus as its culmination.

The proof is in the operation:

log₁₀(KEY) → JESSE + JESUS
text


This repository presents that key and its logarithmic function. It opens what no man can shut: the **arithmetic link between the Davidic covenant and the person of Jesus Christ.**

He that hath the key of David saith these things. And the numbers confirm His word.
