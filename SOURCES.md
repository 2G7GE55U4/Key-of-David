Sources and References: The Key of David

This document provides a consolidated reference for the key numerical constants and sources used in the "Key of David" mathematical testimony. The primary focus is on the canonical architecture of the King James Bible (1611/1769).
I. The Canonical Word Count: 788,258

The foundational constant for the Grand Canon is the established total word count of the King James Bible. The figure 788,258 is utilized as the canonical, published standard.
Primary Citation

    Gideons International. "Bible Statistics from Gideons International," as cited in:

        Lynn, Heidi. "Staggering Bible Statistics: The Miracle of God’s Word." TBL Faith News, 30 May 2015. The article lists "Total Words in Bible: 788,258" under the explicit heading "Bible Statistics from Gideons International."

Corroborative & Contextual Sources

    General Reference. The figure 788,258 is widely repeated as the word count for the King James Version across numerous biblical reference works, statistical compilations, and online encyclopedias, establishing it as a commonly accepted value.

    Textual Variance Note. Independent digital analysis of modern, clean KJV text files (e.g., from Bible Gateway) yields a count of approximately 789,633 words. This minor variance (~0.17%) is consistent with known differences between specific digital editions, modern spellings, and the standardized 1769 Blayney Oxford text upon which the classic statistic is based. This does not invalidate the canonical number but demonstrates the precision required to isolate a single consistent dataset for geometric proof.

        Example: "King James Bible Statistics." BibleBelievers.com. Provides a detailed, book-by-book analysis of a 1769-based text totaling 789,314 words, illustrating the close clustering of counts from authoritative editions.

II. The Ancillary Canon: 1,866 Words

The total of 1,866 ancillary words is derived from the sum of non-scriptural textual components present in the canonical 1611/1769 printings of the King James Bible.
Component	Word Count
Table of Contents	383
Book Titles	85
The word "CHAPTER"	1,034
The word "PSALM"	150
Testament Dividers	6
Hebrew Alphabet in Psalm 119	22
Subscriptions in the Pauline Epistles	186
TOTAL	1,866
III. The Grand Canon: 790,124 Words

The Grand Canon is the sum of the canonical Scripture and its ancillary structure:
788,258 (Scripture) + 1,866 (Ancillary) = 790,124 (Grand Canon)
IV. The Master Key & Geometric Proof

    Master Key: 0.6912275131084

    Core Geometric Proof:
    √[790,124 − 0.6912275131084] = 888.8888...

    Mathematical Testimony: This operation, using the Master Key upon the Grand Canon, yields the signature sequence 888.8888..., which is presented as the geometric signature of Jesus Christ (Greek Ἰησοῦς = 888).

V. The Key of David Logarithmic Proof

A secondary, reinforcing proof derives from the lexical numbering of Strong's Concordance:

    log₁₀(2807) × 1000 = 3449.2424...

    G2807 - κλείς (kleis): "THE KEY".

    G/H3448-3449: The span pointing to "JESSE" (the root of David) and "A GREEN SHOOT".

    .2424: The fractional remainder resolving to G2424 - Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous): "JESUS".

    This logarithmically links "The Key" directly to "Jesus."

This document serves to anchor the mathematical testimony in cited references and transparently declared constants. The proof invites verification of its arithmetic, not the sourcing of its initial terms.
