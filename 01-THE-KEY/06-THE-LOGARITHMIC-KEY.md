# The Logarithmic Key: From "The Key" to "Jesus"

## The Operation
`log₁₀(2807) × 1000 = 3449.2424...`

## The Lexical Decoding
1.  **G2807 - κλείς (kleis)**: **"THE KEY"**. (As in, "the key of David" - Revelation 3:7).
2.  **G/H3448-3449**: The result points to the span **3448-3449**.
    *   **H3448 - יִשַׁי (Yishay)**: **"JESSE"** (the root of the line of David).
    *   **G3448 - μόσχος (moschos)**: **"A GREEN SHOOT"** (a symbol of new life from a stump - Isaiah 11:1).
3.  **G2424 - Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous)**: **"JESUS"**. The fractional remainder `.2424` resolves to the Strong's number for the Messiah's name.

## The Geometric Statement
The logarithmic function, using the number for "THE KEY," directly yields the numbers for the **ROOT (Jesse)** and the **FRUIT (Jesus)**. The Key of David is not merely about David, but about the one who springs from his root and holds its authority.

> *"I, Jesus... am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star."* — Revelation 22:16
