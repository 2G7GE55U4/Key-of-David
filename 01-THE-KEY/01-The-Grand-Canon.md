# The Grand Canon: 790,124 Words


## The Manuscript and the Book

The King James Version of the Bible (1611) contains a specific, verifiable number of words.

*   **Gideon's Manuscript Word Count:** **788,258** (the inspired text).
*   **Apparatus Additions (7 elements):** **+1,866** (the structure that makes it a book).

| Element | Word Count |
| :--- | :---: |
| TABLE OF CONTENTS | 383 |
| BOOK TITLES | 85 |
| "CHAPTER" | 1,034 |
| "PSALM" | 150 |
| Testament Dividers | 6 |
| Hebrew Alphabet (Psalm 119) | 22 |
| Subscriptions (Pauline Epistles) | 186 |
| **TOTAL APPARATUS** | **1,866** |

### **The Total Canonical Structure:**

788,258 + 1,866 = 790,124 words
text


## The Divine Lexicon Key

The number of apparatus words (1,866) is not arbitrary. It is derived from the Bible's own lexical index.

*   **Hebrew Strong's Lexicon Entries:** **H8674**
*   **Greek Strong's Lexicon Entries:** **G5523**
*   **KJV Chapters:** **1189**

### **The Derivation:**

[1189 - 1] × [8674 / 5523] = 1188 × 1.570523... ≈ 1,866
text


The structure of the book is mathematically linked to the lexicon that defines its words.

## The Key of David and the Chapter Count

The total chapter count (1189) is itself derived from the name "David".

*   **H1732 = "DAVID"** (דָּוִד)
*   **G1138 = "DAVID"** (Δαυίδ)
*   The difference: `1732 - 1138 = 594`
*   `594 × 2 + 1 = 1189`

Thus:

[1732 (H) - 1138 (G)] × 2 + 1 = 1189
text


**1189** is also the gematria value of **"KEY OF DAVID"** in Jewish Gematria.

## The Ontological Factorization

The Grand Canon number (790,124) factors into prime numbers that correspond to key theological concepts:

790,124 = 2 × 2 × 53 × 3,727
text


*   **H2 = "THE FATHER"** (הָאָב)
*   **G53 = "WASHED PURE"** (ἁγνός)
*   **H3727 = "THE MERCY SEAT"** (כַּפֹּרֶת)
*   **G3727 = "THE OATH"** (ὅρκος)

**Theological Statement:** *The Father, through the purity of the covenant oath, provides the mercy seat.*

## The Manuscript Key

The manuscript word count (788,258) is generated by a product involving the number 2807 (G2807 = "THE KEY"):

2807.594 × 280.7594 ≈ 788,258
text


Where `2807.594` is derived from:
*   `G2807 = "THE KEY"`
*   `594` from the Davidic difference above (`1732 - 1138 = 594`).

## The 888.8888... Signature

Using the Grand Canon and a precise constant derived from the presenter's identification number (`0.6912275131084`):

√[790,124 - 0.6912275131084] = √790,123.30877... = 888.8888...
text


*   **888** is the Greek isopsephy for **"Ἰησοῦς" (Jesus)**.
*   The inverse of this number yields a command:
    ```
    1 / 888.8888... = 0.0011250001125...
    ```
    The sequence `001125` corresponds to **G1125 = "AS IT IS WRITTEN" (γέγραπται)**.

## The Earth's Circumference

The same three numbers that define the Bible's canonical structure—its total words (790124), chapters (1189), and books (66)—yield the mean circumference of the Earth:

√[790,124 × 1189 × 66] / 10 = 24,900.6... miles
text


This is independently confirmed by the same constant:

0.6912275131084¹⁰ × 10⁶ = 24,900.6... miles
text


And by the combination of the Hebrew and Greek lexicon totals:

Let X = 8674 (Hebrew) + 5523 (Greek) + 0.6912275131084 = 14197.6912275131084
Then: X × 1.2⁻⁵⁹ × 7⁷ × 10⁻¹ = 24,900.6... miles
text


Also note: `3.605858⁷ × π ≈ 24,900.6`, where **H5858 = "EBAL"** (a mountain).

## The Christological Constants

The identification number transforms into the primary titles of the Messiah:

∜[6912275131084 × ∜625] = 2424.0... → G2424 = "JESUS"
∜[6912275131084 × 137] = 5547.0... → G5547 = "CHRIST"
text


Where `∜625 = 5` (grace) and `137` is linked to the fine-structure constant (α).

## The Key of David Logarithm

The logarithm of 2807 (THE KEY) yields the lineage of David and the name of Jesus:

log₁₀(2807) × 10³ = 3448.2424...
text


*   **H3448 = "JESSE"** (father of David)
*   **G3448 = "A GREEN SHOOT"** (the Branch)
*   The decimal part `.2424` points to **G2424 = "JESUS"**.

## The Sacrificial Equation

A profound zero-sum equation emerges from the numbers:

4196 - 2378 - 1818 = 0
text


*   **H4196 = "ALTAR"** (מִזְבֵּחַ)
*   **G2378 = "SACRIFICE"** (θυσία)
*   **H1818 = "BLOOD"** (דָּם)

Further, note that `237.8³ ≈ 2424 × 5547`, linking sacrifice to Jesus and Christ.

## The Alpha and Omega

The identification number also encodes the beginning and the end:

6912275131084 / 1234567891.0 ≈ 5598
text


*   **G1 = "ALPHA"**
*   **G5598 = "OMEGA"**

## Conclusion

The Grand Canon (790,124) is the foundation. From it, and through the divine lexicon, we derive:
1.  The signature of Christ (888.8888...)
2.  The dimensions of Creation (24,900 miles)
3.  The key theological concepts (Father, Mercy Seat, Oath)
4.  The identity of the Messiah (Jesus, Christ)

The structure is intentional, mathematical, and verifiable.
