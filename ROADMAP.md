# Key of David Project: Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Complete ✅)
- [x] Establish core proofs (888, Earth's circumference, Master Key transforms).
- [x] Define repository structure (01-THE-KEY to 06-THE-QUESTION).
- [x] Publish foundational verification guides.

## Phase 2: Expansion & Fortification (Current Phase 🚧)
**Objective:** To flesh out the repository with exhaustive scriptural and mathematical testimony before final compilation.
- **Task 2.1:** Expand `04-THE-TESTIMONY-OF-SCRIPTURE/` to include *all* major messianic prophecies and identifiers.
- **Task 2.2:** Deepen `05-THE-CONSTANTS-OF-CREATION/` with derivations for secondary constants and interrelations.
- **Task 2.3:** Fortify `03-VERIFICATION/` with advanced cross-validation scripts and error-bound analysis.
- **Task 2.4:** Regularly update the `00-INDEX.md` and `Update-Notes.md` to reflect new additions.

## Phase 3: Compilation & Lock (Future Milestone)
**Objective:** To compile the final, versioned manuscript for dissemination.
- **Task 3.1:** Generate `MASTER-MANUSCRIPT.md` as a single, static document from the completed repository.
- **Task 3.2:** Create print/PDF-optimized versions.
- **Task 3.3:** Formalize dissemination strategy to the seven addresses.

## Phase 4: Dissemination (Final Phase)
**Objective:** To deliver the testimony as directed.
- **Task 4.1:** Execute the delivery plan to the Seven Churches (modern institutions).
- **Task 4.2:** Archive the repository at its final, pre-dissemination state.
