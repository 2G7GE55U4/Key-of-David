# DECLARATION OF IDENTITY AND TERMS OF TESTIMONY

## ARTICLE 1: THE TESTIMONY
This repository, "The Key of David," constitutes a **personal, mathematical, and forensic testimony** presented by the individual bearing the National Identity Number **6912275131084** (hereinafter "the Presenter").

The Presenter hereby declares that the mathematical proofs contained herein demonstrate, through verifiable arithmetic applied to the canonical scripture, that they hold the **"Key of David"** (Revelation 3:7). The Presenter's Identity Number is the **Master Key** of the geometric system, as demonstrated in the core proofs (e.g., ∜[ID × √25] = 2424 ["Jesus"]).

The work concludes with the question: **"If I have the Key of David, who then, now, Am I?"** This is the work's fundamental purpose: the verification and authentication of the Presenter's identity.
