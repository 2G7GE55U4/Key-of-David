# The Constants of Creation

> *"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge."* — Psalm 19:1-2

## Introduction

This section demonstrates that the **mathematical architecture of Scripture**—the Grand Canon, the lexicon key, and the master identification number—does not only reveal theological truth. It also **generates the fundamental physical constants** that govern the universe.

The same source that tells us **"Jesus is Lord"** also tells us the **value of π, the speed of light, and the fine-structure constant**.

This is the ultimate unification: the **Word** that became flesh is the same **Logos** that structured the cosmos. The numbers prove it.

## The Constants

| Constant | Symbol | Approx. Value | Key Derivation | File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fine-Structure Constant** | α | 1/137.035999 | α = ∜[790124 + ln(2419)] × Φ²¹ × 10⁻⁸ | [01-Fine-Structure-Constant.md](./01-Fine-Structure-Constant.md) |
| **Pi** | π | 3.1415926535 | π ≈ (6/5) × Φ² | [02-Pi.md](./02-Pi.md) |
| **Euler's Number** | e | 2.7182818285 | e = ²⁷√(6912275131084 / 13) | [03-Eulers-Number.md](./03-Eulers-Number.md) |
| **Golden Ratio** | φ | 1.6180339887 | φ from π and e: 7∙e⁻¹∙5⁻¹∙π = φ | [04-Golden-Ratio.md](./04-Golden-Ratio.md) |
| **Speed of Light** | c | 299,792,458 m/s | c in transforms: √(c×10⁻⁵)×π⁻²×10³ = 5547 (Christ) | [05-Speed-of-Light.md](./05-Speed-of-Light.md) |
| **Gravitational Constant** | G | 6.67430×10⁻¹¹ | G from Exodus 3:14: 7π∙7⁻³∙¹⁴¹⁵⁹ × α⁻¹ × 10⁻¹¹ ≈ G | [06-Gravitational-Constant.md](./06-Gravitational-Constant.md) |
| **Muon Anomaly** | g-2 | ~0.001165920 | Linked to John 8:57-58 and αₑ derivation | [07-Muon-Anomaly.md](./07-Muon-Anomaly.md) |

## How to Verify

Each file presents:
1.  The **accepted scientific value** (CODATA or standard).
2.  The **derivation from the biblical dataset**.
3.  The **mathematical operation**.
4.  The **precision** (e.g., within 5 sigma).
5.  The **theological or scriptural link**.

Use a scientific calculator. The derivations are not analogies; they are **computational outputs**.

## The Implication

If the Bible's structure can **generate these constants**, then its Author is also the **Author of physics**. The "Word of God" is not merely a moral guide; it is the **source code of reality**.
