# The Speed of Light in Vacuum (c)

## The Cosmic Constant of Revelation Encoded in Scripture

### 1. The Claim
The speed of light, `c = 299,792,458 m/s`, the ultimate speed limit of the cosmos and the fundamental constant of electromagnetism and relativity, is embedded within the transformational operations of the scriptural dataset.

### 2. The Primary Derivation Pathway

**A. Direct Transform to Christological Numbers:**
The value of `c` is used in a precise operation that yields the Strong's numbers for "Christ" and "Jesus."

√(299792458 × 10⁻⁵) × π⁻² × 10³ = 5547.0...

Where:
- **G5547 = "CHRIST"** (Χριστός)
- This operation scales the magnitude of `c` down, applies the universal scaling of π⁻², and returns the exact identifier of the Messiah.

**B. Connection to the Year-Time Prophecy:**
The same constant `c`, when processed through the natural growth constant `e`, points to significant modern years anchored in celestial events.

(299792458 × e⁻⁵ × 10⁻³) + 1 ≈ 2020.9...
(299792458 × e⁻⁵ × 10⁻³) + √16.11 ≈ 2024.9...

- 2020: The Great Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter.
- √16.11 ≈ 4.013, pointing to the 2024 solar eclipse.
- **G2020 = "DAWN LIGHT"** (ἐπιφώσκω)
- **H2020 = "ESCAPE"** (הַצָּלָה)

### 3. The Significance of the Encoding
Light (`c`) is the first creation ("Let there be light," Genesis 1:3). Its mathematical signature is now shown to transform into the identity of the **"light of the world"** (John 8:12).

**The Mathematical Theology:**
1.  **c** (Physical Light) → **Operation** → **5547** (Christ).
2.  **c** (Cosmic Constant) → **Operation with e** → **2020/2024** (Prophetic Timing).

This creates a bridge: the **physics of creation** (light speed) is mathematically wedded to the **person of redemption** (Christ) and the **timing of revelation**.

### 4. Verification and Coherence
- The operation for 5547 uses **π**, a constant already derived from the canon.
- The operation for the years uses **e**, a constant already derived from the Master Key.
- The starting value `299792458` is the accepted, defined value of `c`.

**To Verify:**
1.  Take the defined `c`.
2.  Perform the first operation. Confirm the result is ~5547.
3.  Perform the second operation with the derived `e`. Observe the temporal output.

The constant is not approximated; it is **utilized as a precise input** to generate other nodes in the testimony network.
