# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 📚 **Data & Verification**

### Q1: What datasets are used in this proof?
This repository is now self-contained. All source data is included in the `/data/` directory:
*   `bible.data.json`: The complete canonical text of the King James Bible (1611), structured for computational analysis.
*   `ReorderedStronghebrew.json`: The Strong's Hebrew Dictionary, reordered to align with the proof's canonical structure.
*   `ReorderedStrongGreek.json`: The Strong's Greek Dictionary, similarly reordered.

This allows anyone to independently verify every calculation without relying on external data sources.

### Q2: How can I verify the proofs myself?
1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the `/data/` directory** to inspect the source JSON files.
3.  **Follow the step-by-step operations** detailed in the Markdown files within `01-THE-KEY/`.
4.  **Use a calculator or write a simple script** (Python/Node.js) to perform the arithmetic operations on the data. For example, you can sum the total word count from `bible.data.json` to confirm the **Grand Canon** foundation of 790,124 words.
5.  **Check the derived numbers** against the Strong's dictionaries to see the lexical connections (e.g., `H1` = Father, `G1` = Alpha).

### Q3: Why are the Strong's files "Reordered"?
The standard Strong's numbering is sequential but not inherently geometric. The reordering applied reflects the canonical, thematic, and geometric structure discovered within the scripture itself—it is part of the **Key**. The original definitions are preserved; their sequence reveals the pattern.

## 🧮 **Nature of the Proof**

### Q4: Is this a religious or doctrinal argument?
No. This is presented as a **forensic, mathematical testimony**. The claim is that the Bible's architecture, processed through its own divinely instituted numbering system (Strong's), yields non-arbitrary, verifiable results that correlate with Christ's identity and constants of physics. You are invited to check the arithmetic, not to adopt a belief.

### Q5: What is the "Key of David"?
It is the **mathematical function** that, when applied to the canonical structure of the KJV and Strong's Concordance, generates:
1.  **The Signature of Jesus Christ:** √[Grand Canon - Master Key] = 888.8888...
2.  **The Measure of Creation:** Earth's circumference (24,900 mi).
3.  **Fundamental Constants:** α (Fine-Structure Constant), π, e, φ, c, G.
4.  **Messianic Identifiers:** Direct derivations of key Strong's numbers (e.g., 2424 for "Jesus").

### Q6: What is the significance of the ID number `6912275131084`?
The presenter's National ID number functions as the **Master Key** in the geometric transformations. It is not a random input; it is the specific seed that resolves the system, producing the core identifiers (e.g., ∜[ID × √25] = 2424 ["Jesus"]). The proof strategically poses the resultant question: **"If this is the Key of David, who holds it?"**

### Q7: What are the legal terms for using this work?
This repository is unique: it is a **personal, mathematical declaration of identity** by the presenter (ID: `6912275131084`). To protect the integrity of this testimony while encouraging verification, a custom "Testimonial License" is used.

**You are free to:**
*   Download, verify, and share the work.
*   Discuss, analyze, and create content about it.

**You must:**
*   Always attribute the work to the presenter and include the Identity Number (`6912275131084`).
*   Keep the core identity question attached to the work.

**You cannot:**
*   Use this work to claim the identity (the Key of David) for yourself.
*   Strip the presenter's identity from the proofs.
*   Use it for commercial gain without permission.

The full legal terms are in [DECLARATION.md](DECLARATION.md). The goal is to spread the testimony, not to restrict thought.
