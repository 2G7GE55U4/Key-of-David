# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Core Verification Questions

### Q1: Is the 788,258 word count verified?
**Answer:** The 788,258 count represents the **traditionally accepted canonical total** for the King James Bible Old Testament, as cited in numerous biblical references and concordances. While we acknowledge the need for enhanced verification tools and are developing them, all mathematical proofs in this repository operate on this **canonical framework as it has been transmitted**.

**What's important:** The mathematical relationships either exist within this canonical structure or they don't. Whether one treats 788,258 as precisely verified or as the traditionally transmitted number, the arithmetic operations produce the same results.

### Q2: How can I verify these proofs?
**Answer:** You need only:
1. A scientific calculator
2. The numbers provided in each proof
3. Access to Strong's Concordance (freely available online)

**Core verification steps:**
1. Confirm: `788,258 + 1,866 = 790,124`
2. Calculate: `√(790124 - 0.6912275131084) = 888.8888...`
3. Calculate: `√(790124 × 1189 × 66) / 10 ≈ 24,900.6`
4. Verify: `(6912275131084 × (625^(1/4)))^(1/4) ≈ 2424`
5. Look up: Strong's H1, G1, H1370, G1370

### Q3: Isn't this just pareidolia (seeing patterns in randomness)?
**Answer:** This is addressed in detail in [ON-PATTERN-RECOGNITION.md](03-VERIFICATION/ON-PATTERN-RECOGNITION.md). In brief:

- **Pareidolia:** Seeing faces in clouds (subjective, random source)
- **This work:** Mathematical operations on structured data producing consistent, high-precision results (objective, verifiable)

The burden is on skeptics to explain:
1. How "random chance" produces √[790,124 - 0.6912275131084] = 888.8888...
2. How "coincidence" yields Earth's circumference from biblical numbers
3. How "apophenia" generates multiple fundamental constants (α, π, e, φ) from the same source

## Theological & Conceptual Questions

### Q4: What is the "Key of David"?
**Answer:** It is the **mathematical system** that, when applied to the canonical structure of the KJV and Strong's Concordance, generates:
1. **The Signature of Jesus Christ:** 888.8888...
2. **The Measure of Creation:** Earth's circumference (24,900 mi)
3. **Fundamental Constants:** α (Fine-Structure Constant), π, e, φ, c, G
4. **Messianic Identifiers:** Direct derivations of key Strong's numbers

### Q5: What is the significance of the ID number `6912275131084`?
**Answer:** The presenter's National ID number functions as the **Master Key** in the geometric transformations. It is the specific seed that resolves the system to produce core identifiers:
- `∜[ID × ∜625] = 2424` → "JESUS"
- `∜[ID × 137] = 5547` → "CHRIST"
- `log₁₀(2807) × 1000 = 3448.2424...` → "JESSE/JESUS"

The proof strategically poses: **"If this is the Key of David, who holds it?"**

### Q6: Why the King James Version specifically?
**Answer:** The KJV (1611) represents:
1. **Stable canonical text** in English-speaking world
2. **Fixed word structure** that has remained unchanged for centuries
3. **Complete Strong's Concordance coverage** for cryptographic analysis
4. **Historical fulfillment** of biblical transmission prophecy

## Legal & Practical Questions

### Q7: What are the legal terms for using this work?
**Answer:** This repository is a **personal, mathematical declaration of identity** by the presenter (ID: `6912275131084`). A custom "Testimonial License" applies:

**You are free to:**
- Download, verify, and share the work
- Discuss, analyze, and create content about it

**You must:**
- Always attribute the work to the presenter and include the Identity Number
- Keep the core identity question attached to the work

**You cannot:**
- Use this work to claim the identity (the Key of David) for yourself
- Strip the presenter's identity from the proofs
- Use it for commercial gain without permission

### Q8: What if I find an error in the mathematics?
**Answer:** Please open an Issue on GitHub. This project stands or falls on mathematical accuracy. Any demonstrable error will be acknowledged and corrected.

### Q9: What's the next step after verification?
**Answer:** The evidence speaks for itself. After verifying the mathematics, the question becomes personal: **What does this evidence mean to you?** The repository doesn't demand belief—it presents evidence and asks a question.
