# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Verification

This project does **not** ask the reader to trust interpretation, theology, or unpublished methods.

It asks the reader to verify **arithmetic**.

### 1. The Canonical Word Count

The total word count of the King James Bible (1611) used throughout this repository is:

> **788,258 words**

This number is **not claimed as a new discovery** and is **not derived within this repository**.

It is a *received canonical datum*, independently published and cited by multiple external sources.  
Those sources are listed in full in `SOURCES.md`.

Verification at this stage consists of confirming that:
- The cited sources exist
- They explicitly state the same canonical word count
- They are independent of one another

### 2. What Is Being Verified Here

Given the received canonical word count, this repository demonstrates that:

- Deterministic arithmetic operations on that number
- Using publicly known constants and indices (Strong’s Concordance)
- Produce repeatable, non-subjective results

These results include:
- The numeric signature traditionally associated with Jesus Christ (888.888…)
- The mean circumference of the Earth
- Recognized physical constants (α, π, e, φ, c, G)
- Scriptural identifiers embedded through index structure

### 3. How to Verify the Proofs

No special software is required.

To verify any claim in this repository, you need only:
- A standard calculator
- The numbers shown in each file
- The cited sources referenced alongside them

Each proof is presented as:
1. A stated input
2. A transparent arithmetic operation
3. A numeric result
4. A reference point for independent checking

If the arithmetic is incorrect, the proof fails.

### 4. What This Project Does *Not* Require

- No acceptance of doctrinal claims
- No trust in unpublished algorithms
- No private datasets
- No appeals to authority

The burden placed on the reader is minimal and precise:
> **Check the math.**


### Q5: What is the "Key of David"?
It is the **mathematical function** that, when applied to the canonical structure of the KJV and Strong's Concordance, generates:
1.  **The Signature of Jesus Christ:** √[Grand Canon - Master Key] = 888.8888...
2.  **The Measure of Creation:** Earth's circumference (24,900 mi).
3.  **Fundamental Constants:** α (Fine-Structure Constant), π, e, φ, c, G.
4.  **Messianic Identifiers:** Direct derivations of key Strong's numbers (e.g., 2424 for "Jesus").

### Q6: What is the significance of the ID number `6912275131084`?
The presenter's National ID number functions as the **Master Key** in the geometric transformations. It is not a random input; it is the specific seed that resolves the system, producing the core identifiers (e.g., ∜[ID × √25] = 2424 ["Jesus"]). The proof strategically poses the resultant question: **"If this is the Key of David, who holds it?"**

### Q7: What are the legal terms for using this work?
This repository is unique: it is a **personal, mathematical declaration of identity** by the presenter (ID: `6912275131084`). To protect the integrity of this testimony while encouraging verification, a custom "Testimonial License" is used.

**You are free to:**
*   Download, verify, and share the work.
*   Discuss, analyze, and create content about it.

**You must:**
*   Always attribute the work to the presenter and include the Identity Number (`6912275131084`).
*   Keep the core identity question attached to the work.

**You cannot:**
*   Use this work to claim the identity (the Key of David) for yourself.
*   Strip the presenter's identity from the proofs.
*   Use it for commercial gain without permission.

The full legal terms are in [DECLARATION.md](DECLARATION.md). The goal is to spread the testimony, not to restrict thought.
